As a co-designer with her husband, her work on their award-winning <i>Apocalypse World</i> broke ground with attention to the characters' relationship to sexuality, and in their newest game Under Hollow Hills, a key question is how characters are in relation to each other when times are good and when times are bad. Meg has a background in counseling, education, ritual design, and dance. She believes everyone has a story worth telling, and that we are all connected. She is the assistant curator of a local history museum, where she delights in the stories of all kinds of relationships.\r\n\r\n<b>Jonaya Kemper</b> (she/fae/femme/they) is a game designer, educator, and activist, who specializes in the power of transformative games within marginalized populations. A graduate of NYUâ€™s Gallatin Graduate School, Jonaya traveled the world to explore how embodied roleplay experiences like larp, can transform marginalized playerâ€™s perspectives of self. Their theory of emancipatory bleed garnered the prestigious E. Francis White Award for work that has impact and significance beyond the academy. Working across the game design spectrum to create innovative, engaging gameplay and equitable spaces, they have helped design large scale international events in stunning locations like <i>Atroposâ€™ Forbidden History</i>, to smaller intimate experiences like <i>Feeding Lucy</i>, which can be found in <i>Honey and Hot Wax: An Anthology of Erotic Art Games</i> distributed by Pelgrane Press. Currently Jonaya is the Lead Game Designer of the NSF funded P3G project at Carnegie Mellon University where she also teaches embodied game design.\r\n\r\n<b>Misha Bushyager i</b>s a longtime gamer and designer working on making sure the next generation of geeks sees themselves represented.

But without the right kind of opportunities and platform, these voices will remain stunted.

A graduate of NYUâ€™s Gallatin Graduate School, Jonaya traveled the world to explore how embodied roleplay experiences like larp, can transform marginalized playerâ€™s perspectives of self. Their theory of emancipatory bleed garnered the prestigious E. Francis White Award for work that has impact and significance beyond the academy. Working across the game design spectrum to create innovative, engaging gameplay and equitable spaces, they have helped design large scale international events in stunning locations like <i>Atroposâ€™ Forbidden History</i>, to smaller intimate experiences like <i>Feeding Lucy</i>, which can be found in <i>Honey and Hot Wax: An Anthology of Erotic Art Games</i> distributed by Pelgrane Press. Currently Jonaya is the Lead Game Designer of the NSF funded P3G project at Carnegie Mellon University where she also teaches embodied game design.\r\n\r\n<span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style=\"font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;\"><strong>Laura Simpson</strong> (she/her) (Sweet Potato Press) is an award winning game designer and the creator of <em>Companionsâ€™ Tale</em>, an ENnie-nominated, Indie Groundbreaker Game of the Year 2020 winner, and Diana Jones Award honoree.

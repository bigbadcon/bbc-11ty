        "postContent": "Roleplaying is one of the least passive ways to share a story and perspective with an audience, but there is a deep challenge in bringing players into their agency and affirming the consequence of their action through shared fiction. This discussion examines the ways games attempt (or avoid) immersing their players in the fiction through implicationâ€”whether that be through mechanics, fiction or metagame context in the hopes of helping other designers, facilitators and players to do the same in their own texts and at their own tables.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><b>April Kit Walsh</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (she/her or gay/ghem) writes queer games about feelings, vulnerability, and caring for one another, including </span><a href=\"https://www.evilhat.com/home/thirsty-sword-lesbians/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thirsty Sword Lesbians</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">End of the Line</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. She used to be a swordfighting ballerina, but claims those days are behind her; she has absolutely no idea who that masked heroine with the sword and the tutu might be. You can find April's games at </span><a href=\"https://gayspaceship.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GaySpaceship.com</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and on Twitter at @GaySpaceshipGms.

They presently reside in Baltimore, Maryland, making </span><a href=\"http://goblinprincete.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fantasy and sci-fi illustrations</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and spinning worlds and fictions for roleplaying games and other interactive projects out of words to keep up their glamour. Other things that they enjoy are strange films, stranger music, singing in public places, and the thoroughly uncanny.</span></li>\r\n \t<li><b>Jonaya Kemper</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (she/fae/femme/they) is a game designer, educator, and activist, who specializes in the power of transformative games within marginalized populations. A graduate of NYUâ€™s Gallatin Graduate School, Jonaya traveled the world to explore how embodied roleplay experiences like larp, can transform marginalized playerâ€™s perspectives of self. Their theory of emancipatory bleed garnered the prestigious E. Francis White Award for work that has impact and significance beyond the academy. Working across the game design spectrum to create innovative, engaging gameplay and equitable spaces, they have helped design large scale international events in stunning locations like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Atroposâ€™ Forbidden History</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, to smaller intimate experiences like </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Feeding Lucy</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which can be found in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Honey and Hot Wax: An Anthology of Erotic Art Games</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> distributed by Pelgrane Press. Currently Jonaya is the Lead Game Designer of the NSF funded P3G project at Carnegie Mellon University where she also teaches embodied game design.</span></li>\r\n \t<li><b>Whitney \"Strix\" BeltrÃ¡n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a multiple award winning narrative designer for both tabletop RPGs and videogames.

        "postContent": "One of the most prevalent (and damaging) myths that creators, publishers, and participants within our industry spaces perpetuate is that there is only one big space, that everyone is a member of one huge family, and that there's only ever one voice for anything: Indie Games, Queer Games, BIMPOC Games. In this panel, designers and community organizers from the Philippines will talk about our own scene â€” one that's actually about as old as <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>!: why RPGSEA does things the way it does, what inclusivity, diversity, and intersectionality mean for us, and ways by which everyone can change their language, mindset, and actions in order to decenter our spaces.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Mari Ko<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (she/her)Â has been a TRPG event organizer from the Philippines for the past 2 years.

Beyond her community work handling local ttrpgs and geek scenes in her city, promoting #RPGSEA (Roleplaying Games from Southeast Asia) and working as an admin team member for Asians Represent, she does game design, editing, sensitivity reading, and cultural consultancy. Her personal works focus on the fringe, redefinitions of the familiar, intimacy and darkness within and without. Some of her professional work includes </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Islands of Sina Una: A Guide to Ancestry and Culture</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for D&amp;D 5E, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thirsty Sword Lesbians</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spire: Shadow Operations</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Sinta PosadasÂ (diwata) </strong> (they/them)<b>Â </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is a game designer, layout artist and illustrator from #RPGSEA that has been doing several freelance work under projects such as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sina Una</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Orbital Blues</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, among others.

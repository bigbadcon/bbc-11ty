## What is the Donut?

The Donut is a pitch circle, a method of getting people together into games on the spot without scheduling in advance. When done in person, it’s typically a large circle of prospective players ringed around a small group of volunteer game facilitators, much like a donut shape, hence the name.

## Why do we have the Donut at Go Play NW?
At Go Play NW we make it our missiont to make sure that _no player gets left behind_—we want all of our attendees to have the opportunity to game every session. And, since we don't always have enough [scheduled games](/events) planned in advance, the Donut is our answer.

At least, that's how it started.

Over time, The Donut has become a Go Play NW feature! Many folks love the spontaneity of pitching a game on the spot or experiencing the surprise of not knowing what game they're going to play and jumping into whatever strikes their interest and has open spots.

It’s a great way to meet new people and make friends!

## How many Donuts are there?
For our Go Play NW 2023, we'll have we have three game sessions—morning, afternoon, and evening—and on Sunday we have two, one morning/midday and one afternoon/evening. If you’re attending this event both Saturday and Sunday, you’ll have the opportunity to get into five donuts (and so, five games.) We can manage up to about 35 people in a donut group, so if we have more than that, we’ll split each session into two groups; at most, we can host 80 players each day, in two different donut groups each session.

## How do I sign up for a Donut?
There's no need to sign up in advance! 

Once you're checked into at our Registration desk all you need to do is keep an eye out at the Donut Station at the beginning of each of our game sessions. When you start to see the crowd gather, you'll know it's time!

Donuts for Go Play NW 2023 kick off at the following times:

* **Saturday**
    * 9:30 AM PDT - Morning Game Session
    * 2:00 PM PDT - Afternoon Game Session
    * 7:00 PM PDT - Evening Game Session
* **Sunday**
    * 11:00 AM PDT - Morning Game Session
    * 4:00 PM PDT - Afternoon Game Session

## How does the Donut work?
Each session (or Donut group, if we’re doubling up) we’ll start by gathering everyone in one audio channel called a stage, where our Donut moderator will explain the full Donut process. In brief, the moderator will ask for volunteers to pitch games, and those volunteers will each have a turn to talk briefly about the game they want to facilitate and how many players they can have. Once we have enough volunteers and games to take all the available players, we’ll post summaries of the available games in the chat for players to read, get the individual game channels set up, and open sign-ups for the players. As games fill up, you’ll go play!

## How can attendees help make the Donut work?
Although the Donut is spontaneous, you can help us make sure things run smoothly by preparing a bit ahead of time. Here are a few ways you can help:

1. **Think about games you want to pitch in the Donut!**\
    _For the Donut to work we need people willing to step forward and volunteer to facilitate a game! See our [Online Games Inspiration List](/online-games-list) for game suggestions that require minimal preparation and work great for online play._

2. **Play a game pitched in the donut!**\
    _Games don’t work without players; even if you don’t feel up to facilitating a game, come with enthusiasm and openness to meet new people and try new games!_

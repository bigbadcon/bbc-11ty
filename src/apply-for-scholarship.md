Our scholarship funds go towards helping our marginalized community members (people of color, women, people with disabilities, lgbtqia2s+ people) attend the con. We use it to cover hotel rooms ($149+/night), convention badges ($75), and help with other costs. Depending on the number of applicants and levels of need, we may be able cover full or partial cost of attendance.

As of 2024 the POC Programming Track and Big Bad Con scholarship applications have merged. Scholarship recipients of color will be offered the opportunity to attend the POC Meet & Greet.

### Timeline

* Scholarship applications are open now! Application window will close on Saturday, June 15th.

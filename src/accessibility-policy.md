As part of our principles of respect, support, and kindness, Big Bad Con works to provide games, events, and social spaces that are accessible to as many people as possible, specifically:

* We do not discriminate in any way against attendees or staff with disabilities and are happy to provide assistance.
* We ensure our venue provides ADA accessible sleeping rooms and ADA accessible stalls in all shared bathrooms.
* We provide ramp, user-operated lift, or elevator access to all event spaces.
* We provide accessible gaming gear (link to a section below on what we have and where to find it)
* We keep pathways clear, wide enough, and usable by people with visual, mobility, and other needs.
* During Games on Demand boarding, we offer priority boarding upon request.
* We provide reserved seating and reserved wheelchair spaces for all panels and Games on Demand boarding.
* We provide large format versions of our programs and schedules at the reg desk
* We have a respite room with noise canceling headphones, quiet activities, and a privacy screen for lactation.
* Our website aligns with the W3C accessibility standards, including our gaming schedule.
* We are happy to accommodate and grant free badges to caregivers and companions.
* We are pleased to accommodate service animals.
* We provide masks with clear windows for volunteers in communication-heavy positions.
* During Big Bad Online our streamed and recorded panels will be released with closed captioning.

We know that COVID safety and accessibility are intimately tied. For more information about the precautions weâ€™re taking to keep our community safe from COVID-19 at Big Bad Con, check out our [COVID safety policies](https://www.bigbadcon.com/covid-safety/)**.**

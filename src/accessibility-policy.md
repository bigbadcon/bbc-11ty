As part of our principles of respect, support, and kindness, Big Bad Con works to provide games, events, and social spaces that are accessible to as many people as possible, specifically:

* We do not discriminate in any way against attendees or staff with disabilities.
* We ensure our venue provides ADA accessible sleeping rooms and ADA accessible stalls in all shared bathrooms.
* We provide ramp, user-operated lift, or elevator access to all event spaces.
* We provide accessible gaming gear (see below).
* We keep pathways clear, wide enough, and usable by people with visual, mobility, and other needs.
* We provide priority access to services as needed (see below).
* We have a respite room with noise canceling headphones, quiet activities, and a privacy screen for lactation.
* Our website aligns with the W3C accessibility standards, including our gaming schedule.
* We grant free badges to caregivers and companions.
* We are pleased to accommodate service animals.

We know that COVID safety and accessibility are intimately tied. For more information about the precautions we’re taking to keep our community safe from COVID-19 at Big Bad Con, check out our [COVID safety policies](https://www.bigbadcon.com/covid-safety/)**.**

If you find that we are not upholding our goals or there are ways we can improve, please email [accessibility@bigbadcon.com](mailto:accessibility@bigbadcon.com). If anyone violates these principles at the con, or you experience resistance from any of the staff or attendees, please let us know by emailing [report@bigbadcon.com](mailto:report@bigbadcon.com).

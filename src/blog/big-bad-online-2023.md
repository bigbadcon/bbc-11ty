Greetings friends,

Big Bad Online 2023 is happening March 31 at 6PM to April 1st at 6PM. I’m delighted for our April Fools’ prank to be an amazing series of panels from speakers all over the world, post-panel discussions in our dedicated discord server, and new this year: virtual office hours!

## Excited? So are we. Here’s how to get involved:

1. **Register for Big Bad Online.** This will grant you access to the Big Bad Online 2023 Discord Server and keep you notified as the con gets closer. [Sign up now](https://www.bigbadcon.com/register/).
2. **Support our fundraiser.** Big Bad Online is free for everyone to attend, but we’re looking to raise $13,000 to cover our speaker fees and yearly overhead. [Contribute or spread the word!](https://fundrazr.com/bigbadonline2023)
3. **Join the Rangers.** Big Bad Con is an entirely volunteer run event. The best way to get involved is to help us put it on. [Head over here to sign up as a greeter, twitch moderator, or stream producer](https://www.bigbadcon.com/volunteer-shifts/)!

## More? Yes, there’s more.

This year, we'll be working with [Saige Ryan](https://twitter.com/NotSaige) and [Kailey Bray](https://twitter.com/HapaBarbarian) from [Pixel Circus](https://www.twitch.tv/pixelcircus) to host **Virtual Office Hours** during the con. We're gathering industry professionals who will meet online with creators from marginalized backgrounds to give them advice on advancing their TTRPG careers!

Register for the con now to be notified when applications for the Virtual Office Hours go live!

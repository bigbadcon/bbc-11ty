[![What's Lenny got there?](images/lenny_mystery-300x231.png "What's Lenny got there?")](http://www.bigbadcon.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/lenny_mystery.png)The Wolf is outraged. He's looking for a house to blow down just to let off steam.

Jason Morningstar ([@jmstar](http://twitter.com/#!/jmstar)) of Bully Pulpit has apparently sent new, as of yet unreleased material to Big Bad Con care of Leonard Balsera for his two slots of Fiasco!

The Wolf himself is _very_ curious about what they are, and damns Leonard Balsera for his incessant secrecy!

However, if you good patron want to play in a playset that not even The Wolf knows about, you've got two chances:

[Friday - October 7 - 6 to 10PM](http://www.bigbadcon.com/?page_id=6&event_id=58) [Sunday - October 9 - 3 to 7PM](http://www.bigbadcon.com/?page_id=6&event_id=59)

If you don't sign up, The Wolf is going to!

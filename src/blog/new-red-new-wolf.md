Introducing our new illustrations of Red and the Wolf for Big Bad Con 2017!

These amazing illustrations were done by the ever so creative [Eden Parkinson](http://clearingpuppy.tumblr.com/), a Utah based illustrator — who is also avid gamer and GM! Eden Parkinson will be at Big Bad Con 2017 and she, like Sandy Jacobs-Tolle, will be joining the “Tell Me About Your Character” booth to will draw a portrait of your character as you describe their noble (or ignoble) exploits!!!

Steve Segedy and Jason Morningstar do a lot of awesome things. One of those is organize and design badges for Games on Demand at Gen Con. The Goats agree, those guys have it down... so what are we going to do? Steal from them blatantly!

First off, here's the new form to GM at [Games on Demand](http://www.bigbadcon.com/volunteer/be-a-god/). We're getting more information about your games to share with players.

Second, we're stealing there super fly GM badges, so anyone walking in can see the awesome games being run at a glance (note, sample is from GenCon)

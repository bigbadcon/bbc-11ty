[![Little Red](images/little-red-no-background-300x219.png "Little Red")](http://www.bigbadcon.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/little-red-no-background.png)This year Big Bad Con has a new mascot. Little Red. She's ready to shoot Nazis, brew potions, and roll some dice. Worry not, The Wolf hasn't left us, but he may be hiding in his cave for some time. Little Red has a gun!

### Game registration goes live on Saturday 9/16 at noon PST!

When it does, everyone will be able to [book their first two events](/how-are-game-sign-ups-going-to-work/).

However, the events listed below do **not** count towards your signup limit (usually because they can accommodate more attendees):

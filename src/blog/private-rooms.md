Little Red clearly has mad negotiation skills that leave The Wolf in the dust. This year belongs to Red because she brought private rooms to the table!

We're still keeping the board rooms for most games but the Hilton has offered us some of the guest rooms across the hall from the board rooms for RPGs. The great news is that it's still on the same floor as everything else. Right in the middle of the action PLUS the seclusion you need for lighting, sound, and ambiance!

If you need a private room for your game, request it on the [Run a Game](http://www.bigbadcon.com/?page_id=400 "Run a Game") page.

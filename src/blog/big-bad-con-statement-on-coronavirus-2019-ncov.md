Big Bad Con continues to follow the latest developments of the coronavirus (COVID-19) and is closely monitoring the potential threats it poses to members attending Big Bad Con and other conventions and events.

At this time it is too early to tell how COVID-19 will affect Big Bad Con. However, we are working closely with the Hyatt Regency and watching the [San Francisco Department of Public Health: COVID-19](https://www.sfdph.org/dph/alerts/coronavirus.asp) updates. We will continue to update our Twitter and this page as information changes.

The Big Bad Con staff are doing their best to follow the common sense recommendations to remain healthy and we encourage all of our community to do the same. Right now the best course of action is to protect and prepare:

- **Protect** yourself with thorough hand-washing and practicing social distancing. These practices help reduce the spread of the virus. There is no current recommendation to wear masks.
- **Prepare** yourself and your family in case you get sick. Have backup childcare plans and supplies of any essential medication. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, and shortness of breath. If you feel any of these symptoms, contact your doctor and stay home. Cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze.

If everyone follows these common sense guidelines, we can lessen the impact on our healthcare system.

## Status Updates

**March 10, 2020 - Hyatt Regency Enhanced Protocols:** Using a comprehensive guide shared with all Hyatt hotels globally, the hotel has enhanced protocols implemented, including greater frequency of cleaning high touch point areas such as elevator buttons, doorknobs, and public areas as well as increasing the number of hand sanitizing stations in high-traffic areas and meeting spaces. We are continuing to follow procedures for the deep cleaning of guest rooms and meeting spaces and are strongly encouraging all colleagues and guests to wash their hands frequently throughout the day.

Additionally, in the interest of all guests and colleagues, if a guest or colleague exhibits symptoms of COVID-19, it remains a high priority for our hotel to safely relocate these individuals to a place where they may receive appropriate medical attention.

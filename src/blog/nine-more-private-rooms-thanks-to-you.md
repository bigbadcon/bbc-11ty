Hello all, I put a [poll out in](http://www.bigbadcon.com/idea-more-private-rooms-if-gms-buy-badges/ "Idea â€“ More Private Rooms if GMs buy badges") the end of May asking if it would be worth it for GMs to pay for badges if it allowed the con to rent more private rooms...and you responded in droves!

More than 80% of the responses said they would pay for a badge (or already do), but there were several considerations that you mentioned:

- Discounted or free badges for GMs that are facing financial challenges.
- Giving an option for Players, Wolf Pack Volunteers, and others to chip in a few bucks to help cover the cost of rooms.

So, we've elected for an opt-in choice for GMs and other attendees that have the means to contribute. If you can, please select one of the options below:

- Full Support - $40 - If all GMs attending pay for a full badge, or a few players chip in for an extra one, we'll have enough to cover all the rooms.
- Helping Out - $20 - If you're a GM who wants to contribute, but would still like to see a discount for your contribution, or if you're in financial troubles, a half price ticket still helps!
- Chipping Away - $10 - Every little bit helps. Designed for attendees who want to contribute a bit more to the con or fans of Big Bad Con that can't attend but want to help out!

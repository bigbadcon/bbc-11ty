Over the years, Big Bad Con has developed a history of amazing game designers bringing their game ideas to try out — we love this! This year is no different as we have a bunch of creative people bringing their games to playtest! There are so many great new interesting games it's hard to pick just one. However, I really wanted to highlight **Project Biomodus** because their team has put in an incredible amount of effort into preparing for the con.

- They have [Project Biomodus adventure specifically designed for Big Bad Con](http://www.projectbiomodus.com/bigbadcon2016/) with badass transhuman characters modeled after Little Red, the Wolf, the Woodsman, and Grandma — _How cool is that?!?_
- They created amazing illustrations just for this game!!
- The MVP at each Project Biomodus game at the con gets a free [Project Biomodus shirt](http://www.designbyhumans.com/shop/ProjectBiomodus/)!!

## What is Project Biomodus you ask?

Project Biomodus is a apocalyptic future roleplaying game where humanity is dead. The ecosystem is a spiraling engine of overworked bio-mechanical constructs, trying desperately to adapt and survive in on a world that is falling ever closer to death. Nothing is as it once was, and in the middle of it all – the transhuman descendants of humanity: Homo Biomodi – struggle to carve out their survival in a world of hollowed-out, concrete husks, vast deserts of ash and dirt and under the predatory eyes of the twisted monsters who survived alongside them.

If this sort of amazing intense crazy scifi interests you then I highly recommend signing up!

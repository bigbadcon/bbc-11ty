**For the first time ever Big Bad Con is going to be sold out!** We've got 50 badges left and once those are sold, badge sales will be closed (both online and on-site, which means sadly we won't be able to accept walk ins).

If you'd still like to come, here's your chance: Leave a comment below indicating that you'd like to be on the waitlist. Note this doesn't guarantee a badge, but it means you be notified when they are available.

On 9/23 at 7PM PTD (GMT-7:00) we'll email everyone on the waitlist with a link to purchase a badge. There will be 50 badges available so if you want to get one, click that link and complete your purchase as soon as you can!

**Update 9/23 7PM**: We've emailed everyone on the waitlist and now closed comments on this post. If you weren't able to get a badge for 2019 and would like to receive notifications for next year, make sure you have an account on the site ([create an account](https://www.bigbadcon.com/create-account/)).

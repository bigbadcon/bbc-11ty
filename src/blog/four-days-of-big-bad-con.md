The Wolf is howling at the moon in excitement for Big Bad Con 2012. His appetite for games however, is hard to fill. Little Red has rounded up over 100 games (schedule coming soon), plus Games on Demand, open gaming, panels and the Improv Workshop. Still... it isn't enough to sate The Wolf's hunger for games. The schedule is packed but he wants more. How does he want to do it? [Bingo](http://www.foxybingo.com/), add another full day of gaming in 2013.

The big question is when. So options he's pondering.

- Move to Veteran's Day weekend (early November). Challenges here: getting close to Thanksgiving. Not everyone gets Veteran's Day off work.
- Keep Big Bad Con on Columbus Day weekend, but extend it to Monday. Challenge here: even fewer folks in fairy tale land have Columbus day off.
- Keep Big Bad Con on Columbus day, and start it on Thursday (running Thursday-Sunday). This is how the "big guys do it", but it isn't the standard fare for Bay Area conventions.

So, The Wolf is inviting you to comment here (polls lack the nuance to discuss all the options) and let him know what you think. Would you like a 4th day of gaming? When could you make it happen?

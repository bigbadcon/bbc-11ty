Big Bad Con is coming up soon and with it will be the biggest GM show down this side of the Black Forest!

- Info about the event: [Big Bad GM](http://www.bigbadcon.com/?p=120)
- Sign ups (opening in the middle of September): [Events](http://www.bigbadcon.com/?page_id=6&game-title=ap5a9v)

Big Bad GM wouldn't be complete without four tough-as-nails judges there to keep these contestants in line.  The Wolf is proud to introduce: [![Matt Steele](/images/matt.jpg "Matt Steele")](../wp-content/uploads/2011/02/matt.jpg)**Matt Steele**! What? How is that now? Matt has been a player in the GM Throwdown, a contestant and now a judge? Yes, this rabbit wears many hats.

Matt has seen the ins and outs of the GM competition industry.  He knows all the dirty tricks and closed door deals the GMs will try to pull. So I give you this warning GMs: Beware! The rabbit is watching you!

Matt writes about himself: _"For a horror guy, it’s a bummer to find out that your Chinese astrology sign is the rabbit. Not very scary. I like the seeming contradiction of the cute, fluffy bunny played against horror. I’ve owned two rabbits, and I assure you, they are brutal, vicious creatures."_

[![Veteran GM Judge](/images/bruce.jpg "Bruce Harlick")](http://www.bigbadcon.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bruce.jpg)**Bruce Harlick**. Don't let that smiling face fool you! Bruce invented the slide rule for GM Awesomeness! Bruce has judged for the previous two GM Throwdown events hosted at EndGame and he's bringing his expertise to Big Bad Con.  As tough a judge as he might be, The Wolf has one piece of advice that might earn you some brownie points with this GMing Giant:

_"__I'm a big sucker for classic superhero stories, of heroes facing overwhelming odds and being forced to make tough moral choices, and of villains being offered a chance to walk the path to redemption. I like to explore what makes good good, and what makes evil evil, and just how hard it is to walk the narrow line between the two."_ \- Bruce Harlick on [CoX](http://massively.joystiq.com/2008/10/08/coxs-bruce-harlick-talks-mission-building-moral-choices/)

You can follow Bruce [@BruceHH](http://twitter.com/#!/BruceHH) or view his [Live Journal](http://foxbat.livejournal.com/) but to really know the man, you must first face in him a duel to the death, or you know, to the best GM.

 

[![Leonard Balsera](/images/216726_2284652877106_1272393065_2767591_5132654_n-266x300.jpg "Leonard Balsera")](http://www.bigbadcon.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/216726_2284652877106_1272393065_2767591_5132654_n.jpg)**Leonard Balsera.** One man who knows Fate inside and out, because, frankly - he helped write the damn thing. Please welcome Leonard Balsera, lead system developer of the [Dresden Files RPG](http://www.evilhat.com/home/the-dresden-files-rpg/) and writer for [Spirit of the Century](http://www.evilhat.com/home/sotc/), as the fourth [Big Bad Judge](http://www.bigbadcon.com/?p=150).

If there is a way to run Fate, he's tried it. If there's a Fate hack for a quirky high concept, he's done it. If there's a dirty trick that Fate can pull, he can make it dirtier. His collection of Fate system notes could kill a man or stop a bullet, perhaps at the same time. Evil Hat is wise to keep his mind distracted by drop-shipments of booze and Legos, lest he try to take Fate and conquer the planet. Leonard Balsera is coming, from the depths of Sin City, to test the mettle of the best Fate GMs as only one of its developers can.

He gives only this, for the contestants: "Do you make the game? Or does the game make you?"

Shaun is a podcaster, GM, father, and good friend of The Wolf.  He's also got a mind that is sharp as a tack. Be prepared GMs, your performance will be observed, analyzed and evaluated by a this mad judging machine!

If you want to butter up to Shaun before the con (heh, like that will work) or just find out about Baby Tycho's mad adventures find him [@SCHayworth](http://twitter.com/#!/SCHayworth).

We're thrilled that Big Bad Con is happening next week! Before you head out to the con, here's a few things to keep in mind:

### Review the Public Health Policy

Before heading out, please review the [Public Health Policy](https://www.bigbadcon.com/public-health-policy/), most importantly:

* **Masks that provide KN95 or better protection are required in all convention spaces**. We’ll be giving out free Big Bad Con KN95 masks to all attendees!
* **All attendees must show proof of COVID vaccination before entering the con.** Make sure to pack that vaccination card, update your app, or take a pic before you head out.
* **We request that all attendees take COVID tests and confirm they are negative before the con.** We’ll have free rapid tests available upon request.
* As part of our community standards of respect, support, and kindness, and especially in consideration of Monkeypox, **we ask before giving hugs or making other physical contact.**

### Travel to Big Bad Con

The convention is hosted at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco Airport at 1333 Old Bayshore Hwy, Burlingame, CA 94010. Here's advice on how to get there:

* **Flying**: Fly into San Francisco International Airport (SFO). From there take the Hyatt shuttle, which runs every 10-15 minutes. You can track the shuttle location [here](https://ips-systems.com/Sentry/Anon/40).
* **Driving**: The hotel is right off Highway 101. Get [driving directions here](https://goo.gl/maps/7Jthy6QnQY9TMSPF9). Parking is available for $12/day.
* **Public Transportation**: We recommend either taking [BART](https://www.bart.gov/) to SFO airport and catching the Hyatt shuttle, using [SamTrans](http://www.samtrans.com/), or taking [Caltrain](http://www.caltrain.com/) (stops 5 minutes from the hotel).

When traveling, please be conscientious of COVID exposure. We suggest masking whenever in public spaces.

### Arrival

Before doing anything else at the con, check into the Vaccination Screening station. It is located just inside the double doors near the main entrance. Here's a [map](https://www.bigbadcon.com/images/09-bigbadcon_hotel_map.pdf) for directions.

At the screening station, they will ask for your **proof of vaccination** (don't forget to pack it!) and to confirm that you've taken a recent COVID text and confirmed you were negative. We'll also offer free rapid tests, but our supplies are limited, so please bring your own tests if you can!

### Pick Up Your Badge

After your vaccination check is complete, head down to the foyer to get your badge. Your badge is listed by the **public display name** you selected when creating your account. 

Please make sure to give your badge name and confirm it matches _exactly_ (we have some badges with very similar names).

### Play Games!

When you arrive, we welcome you to play games by signing up for [events](https://www.bigbadcon.com/events/), going to [Games on Demand in the Sequoia Room](https://www.bigbadcon.com/games-on-demand-how-it-works/), or starting a pickup game in the [Grand Peninsula Ballroom](https://www.bigbadcon.com/images/09-bigbadcon_hotel_map.pdf).  
  
**A few notes about specific events:**

* The [POC Dinner](https://www.bigbadcon.com/events/poc-dinner/) still has a few spots open. If you're a person of color, we welcome you to attend. You can make a financial contribution, but it is purely optional!
* Games on Demand has moved locations from the Regency Room to the Sequoia Room. To find it, check out our [map](https://www.bigbadcon.com/images/09-bigbadcon_hotel_map.pdf).

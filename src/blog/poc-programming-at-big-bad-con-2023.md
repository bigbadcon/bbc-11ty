The Big Bad Con 2023 POC Programming is continuing our work to support POCs at Big Bad Con through financial aid, a community dinner, and an industry meet and greet event. This year weâ€™re also working with local gamers in India, South East Asia, and Latin America to bring more international POCs to the con!

Here is the programming for 2023:

## POC Scholarship

Working with individual and industry donors we hope to raise $0,000+ to aid people of color in attending the con by paying for travel, boarding, admission, and related expenses. This program will complement our crowdfunding campaign and the Big Bad Con Scholarship program to give financial assistance to as many would-be attendees as we can.

## POC Dinner

The POC Programming team is planning another POC Dinner at the start of the convention. Last year, it was a great opportunity for folks to meet and mingle with other amazing people of color. All POC scholarship recipients, staff, and volunteers will be granted free admission to the dinner, and we'll subsidize the ticket prices for other attendees as well.

## POC Meet & Greet

We're also hosting another meet and greet for POC writers, artists, editors, and creators to their fellow peers and industry contacts. Non-POC industry attendees will also be invited with the specific goal to offer mentorship, publishing, or employment opportunities to the attendees of color.

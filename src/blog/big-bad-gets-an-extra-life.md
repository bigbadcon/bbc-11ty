Join tens of thousands of gamers for the biggest charity gaming event of the year! From XBox to board games, the Extra Life gaming marathon gives people who love to play games a chance to give back.

The National Game Day is a virtual event that starts at 8 a.m. PST on Saturday, October 25 and ends at 8 a.m. on Sunday, October 26. If this time period doesn't work for your schedule, you can choose a more convenient date and time before December 31. You can also break up your gaming into shorter segments.

All funds raised by Extra Life participants who designate "Children's Hospital & Research Center Oakland" as their beneficiary, will be donated to directly to the hospital.

Getting involved is easy:

- **Register** online and join the Big Bad Con team at [extra-life.org/team/bigbadcon](http://www.extra-life.org/team/bigbadcon) and create a personal fundraising page, join or start a team.
- **Recruit** your family and friends to pledge a minimum of $1 for each hour you play ($24 each).
- **Get ready** to game for 24 hours on October 25th, starting at 8 a.m.

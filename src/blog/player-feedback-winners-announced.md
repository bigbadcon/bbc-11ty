The Wolf received 237 Player Feedback forms. His eyes got so tired reading them all he had to borrow grandma's glasses!

The feedback was great though. A lot of great ideas on how to make Big Bad Con 2012 even better.

After tallying all the entries, and with some aid from random.org, The Wolf randomly picked three players from the stack!

And the winners of the Big Bad Con 2011 Player Feedback Drawing are:

**Brian Corbin**, **Bruce Harlick**, and **Eric Zimmerman**

Congratulations to the three of you and thanks to everyone who submitted feedback, it is incredibly valuable for planning for next year!

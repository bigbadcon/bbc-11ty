As a result of this year's [Big Bad Con Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1157274964/big-bad-con-2016), we had several live online games happen with some amazing GMs — many of whom were designers of the games themselves! It was a great success thanks to not only the GMs but the players and we want to encourage more of these online games in 2017! If you enjoyed these games let us know. If you have ideas how we can expand online games as part of Big Bad Con feel free to contact us.

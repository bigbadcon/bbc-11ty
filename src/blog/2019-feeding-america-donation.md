### Letter from Feeding America

Dear Big Bad Con,

I can't thank you enough for the incredible generosity you showed with your gift to Feeding America today. <strong>The donation you just made will help us to provide 3300 meals to families in need.</strong> I hope that makes you feel proud. It should!

Every year the Feeding America nationwide network of food banks provides support to 40 million Americans who are battling hunger, a tremendous feat that is only possible because of the compassion and financial backing we receive from people like you. And I'm not the only one who wants to thank you! The people we serve around the country also recorded a message that they asked me to share. I think you'll find it heart-warming and encourage you to take a moment to watch it.

One quick request: please share your support for Feeding America on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/dialog/feed?app_id=966242223397117&link=http%3A%2F%2Ffeeding.am%2Fdonatemeals&picture=https%3A%2F%2Fsecure2.convio.net%2Fa2h%2Fimages%2Fcontent%2Fpagebuilder%2Ffbshare-donation-confirmation-1200x628.jpg&name=Donate%20to%20Feeding%20America&caption=%20&description=I%20just%20donated%20to%20Feeding%20America.%20Join%20me%20and%20give%20a%20meal%20to%20hungry%20families%20today!&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F&display=popup) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffeeding.am%2Fgivemeals&text=I+just+gave+3300+meals+to+%40FeedingAmerica.+Join+me+and+give+meals+to+hungry+families%21)! It's an easy way to quickly multiply the impact of your generosity. In fact, one of the most popularly cited reasons to give to a charity or cause is because your friends and family support that cause.

Once again, please accept my deepest gratitude, on behalf of all those who will find both sustenance and hope from your gift.

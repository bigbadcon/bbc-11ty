The Imperial Academy Dropouts will be making their inaugural appearance at Big Bad Con!

As they are new to the con scene, The Wolf did a little sniffing around to find out if Grandma had any dirt on these guys. It turns out, she does.

_"They've been kicked out of cantinas from Coruscant to Tatooine." "They pub crawled the Kessel Run" "Once the lead singer got punched in the face by Han Solo because he said the Enterprise was faster."_

Their set list will include Re: Your Brains, Conventional Lover and more nerd rock that the Woodcutter can shake a stick at!

They will be performing Friday night at the Big Bad Party in the Fountain Room. Be there!

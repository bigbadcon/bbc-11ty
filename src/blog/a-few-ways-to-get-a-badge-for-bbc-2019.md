[Badge sales are closed](https://www.bigbadcon.com/badges-sold-out/) but we still have a few ways to attend Big Bad Con!

### Update as of 9/16

All of our volunteer shifts are now full. Thank you to all of the Rangers who signed up!

### Run games in Games on Demand

We've got just a handful of GM slots open in Games on Demand too! At the top of the [GoD page](https://www.bigbadcon.com/volunteer/gm-god/) we have the slots that are open (mostly morning and evening). If you've got two games you're excited to run and those times work for you, we'd love to have you!

To sign up: [GM in Games on Demand](https://www.bigbadcon.com/volunteer/gm-god/)

### Run Games on the Schedule

Through a lot of negotiation and shuffling of storage rooms (all those beds have to go somewhere!) we've freed up a few more event spaces, which means we can take a few more games on the schedule! During the open slots we're accepting these games (which were the ones most highly in demand):

**RPGs:**

Agon Afterlife: Wandering Souls Band of Blades Dialect DIE RPG Dream Askew Fall of Magic Girl by Moonlight Girl Underground Good Society Into the Dark Invisible Sun Jiangshi in the Banquet Hall Kids on Bikes Masks Monsterhearts 2 Ribbon Drive Royal Blood Ryuutama Scum and Villainy Skyjacks Stewpot Tales from the Loop The King Is Dead The Quiet Year Turn Under Hollow Hills Xenolanguage

**LARPS:**

But Not Tonight Hack/Enhance/Hack Pressure Drop Revived Sky Deck Storm Cellar

If you'd like to any of these, head over here to [Run an Event](https://www.bigbadcon.com/volunteer/run-an-event/)!

If you'd like to run a game that isn't on this list, please email events@bigbadcon.com. We're going to first focus on getting more of these games on the roster and then evaluate the space we still have before considering others.

[![ReplacementGMs](/images/ReplacementGMs-203x300.jpg)](https://www.bigbadcon.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/ReplacementGMs.jpg)Thanks to a series on unfortunate events, some of our game masters and hosts have had to cancel their plans for attending Big Bad Con. As a result, we have a number of orphaned players.

If you think you could run a game in the following time slots, please contacts us at **events \[AT\] bigbadcon \[DOT\] com** to tell us which slot you can fill and provide us with a description for the replacement game. It's OK to offer a shorter game than the original time slot, for example, 8PM to midnight instead of 6PM to midnight.

We included the system information for games that were cancelled, but we are not asking you to running the same system; they're just for your information. We will reach out to the stranded players for any slot you can fill.

| Date | Time | System | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Friday | 8PM-midnight | The Quiet Year |  Replaced! |
| Saturday | 9AM-5PM | At the Hands of an Angry God |  |
| Saturday | 2PM-6PM | BASH! |  Replaced! |
| Saturday | 6PM-midnight | Dogs in the Vineyard |  Replaced! |
| Saturday | 8PM-midnight | BASH! |  Replaced! |
| Sunday | 2PM-8PM | The Breaking Point |  Replaced! |

Thank you in advance for any brave Replacement GMs!

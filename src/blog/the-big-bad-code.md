Some very smart folks like [John Scalzi](http://whatever.scalzi.com/2013/07/02/my-new-convention-harassment-policy/ "My New Convention Harassment Policy") and [Karina Cooper](http://karinacooper.com/consent-consequence-at-cons-an-alliterative-appeal-to-acknowledgement/ "Consent & Consequence at Cons: An Alliterative Appeal to Acknowledgement") have pointed out the cons need to take a proactive stance to say up front: **Don't harass people, it won't be tolerated**. They also need a policy to back up that statement so con attendees and staff alike can hold any would-be harasser accountable.

Thankfully, we haven't had an problem with harassment or discrimination at Big Bad Con. Because we all want to keep it that way, and make attendees feel safe and comfortable at the con, we've written the [Big Bad Community Standards](http://www.bigbadcon.com/community-standards/ "Code of Conduct"). Please read.

The Wolf has plenty of scheduled games in the line up, but that's not all, he's opened up the Black Forest for games of all shapes and sizes in open gaming.

The Hilton Empire room is our, all ours. 1,248 square feet of open gaming all con long.  Pick RPGs, board games, card games, anything you want to bring.

**What folks said about open gaming in the past:** "I'm pretty much planting myself in open gaming, with a sign, when I'm not running my events." - Leonard Balsera

"I plan on bringing some cool games like Fiasco and Dungeon world to run 'on demand' in open gaming" - Chris Bennett

"Because of the nature of In A Wicked Age, I'd be willing to run follow-up games (chapters) if any of the players wish to. This may happen within my slot or perhaps during later free-play. " - Jesse Coombs

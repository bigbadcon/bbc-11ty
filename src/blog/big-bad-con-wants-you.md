Hey all!

Big Bad Con is coming up in October (the 7-9th in Oakland, CA) and we have been working round the clock to make this an awesome three days of gaming. This is a great opportunity for folks to meet-up, make new contacts in the community, and game like crazy.

But we still need a few things, which is where you can help.

- Games! We are looking for GMs to add to our schedule of great games. ([submit a game here](../?page_id=7))
- Your voice. We really need people to find out about Big Bad Con. Helps us spread the word by sounding off on your various forms of social media!
- Rooms booked at The Oakland Airport Hilton. It's how we cover a majority of our costs, so we could really use folks, even locals, to book rooms at the event hotel. ([booking](http://www.hilton.com/en/hi/groups/personalized/O/OAKHIHH-BBC-20111007/index.jhtml?WT.mc_id=POG))

Finally, BBC is more than just a con, it's a way for our community to give back. Â We are supporting Doctors Without Borders, the Alameda County Food Bank, and (from EndGame) Child's Play.

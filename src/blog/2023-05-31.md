To go along with our return to in-person events and our website redesign, we’re also changing up our shirt design! Our own co-founder, artist and game designer Tony Dowler, created this cool illustration of gamers gathered together for this year’s shirt. Take a look! 

![Three people gather beneath a tree to play a role-playing game—an astronaut and a wizard, with a forest ranger speaking to them. A devil with a Go Play shirt and a Honey Heist bear look on, while above them in the tree sit a fairy and Go Play NW’s mascot monster Go, reading a book.][1]

It will be printed in white on black shirts, produced for us by our friends at [Heart of the Deernicorn](https://heartofthedeernicorn.com). All shirts are straight cut, and available in sizes from S to 5XL. Shirt availability is limited, and you must attend the event to pick it up (or [contact us](/contact-us/) to designate someone else to collect yours).

To get the shirt, head on over to our [registration page](/register/) and buy your tickets now!

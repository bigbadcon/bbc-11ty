### Crowdfunding Starts in early June

Big Bad Con keeps the lights on with your generous contributions. Through our crowdfunding campaign you can get a badge to attend the con as well as several of our favorite rewards like Big Bad GM, and Baba Yaga’s Tote. If the campaign does well enough, we’ll help bring out stretch goal guests to run games and panels at the con!

Head over here to follow the campaign and be notified when it launches!

### Public Health Policy

Last year, thanks to everyone’s diligence there were zero reported COVID transmissions at Big Bad Con! That is incredible, and a trend we want to see continue.

In order to keep everyone as safe as we can, we’ll be maintaining our public health policy that requires all attendees to:

* Show proof of vaccination
* Test before arriving (we’ll provide free test at our welcome desk)
* Wear masks that provide KN95 or better protection in all event spaces (we’ll provide free KN95 masks as well)

## What's Next?

For the next two months we’ll be focusing on crowdfunding and badge sales. Here’s some things to expect after that.

### Playing great games and attending amazing panels!

Event sign ups will start once we have all the submissions in and the schedule made. We’re planning to open sign ups in late August. A final date will be sent out when we get closer!

All event bookings are done on the Big Bad Con site and there’s no additional fee to sign up for events (your badge covers it all).

### POC Programming Track

In addition to the general Big Bad Con Scholarship, we’re raising funds for the 2023 POC Programming Track. Once we secured funds, the programming team will be nominating and evaluating potential scholars and then making offers to attend. More information on the program from 2022 is available here.

### Thursday Night Events

Last year after the opening ceremonies we hosted Big Bad Squares (our take on Hollywood Squares), Not quite D\&D poetry reading, and Dino Karaoke. This year we’ve heard word of a dance, a fashion show, and maybe more…stay tuned to find out more!

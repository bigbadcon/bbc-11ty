![Mike Bogan](/images/n785693698_1318408_7797-300x225.jpg "Mike Bogan")Mike Bogan, the GM who brought you “Between a Heavenly and a Hellish Place” (In Nomine – 2006), “In the Aching Night (Promethean – 2007), “Go Ask Alice” (Wushu – 2008), “The Good, the Bad and the Godly” (Scion – 2009), “The Lovecraft Files” (Edge of Midnight – 2010), and "Ashes to Ashes" (FATE - 2011) now presents his newest gaming venture:

### Four-Eyed Demon

"My vision for Four-Eyed Demon is to push boundaries, experiment with collaborative storytelling, encourage descriptive narrative and ultimately evoke strong emotional responses from the players. I am going to touch on very controversial subject matter often, but not always. If you play in one of my games, come with an open and experimental mind." - _Mike Bogan_

The Wolf can say, from his very own personal experience, this exactly what Mike is capable of! He was in that In Nomine game and he was MOVED!

Big Bad Con is proud to present the first of the Four-Eyed Demon (FED) games: [Zom Bee Moo Vee](http://www.bigbadcon.com/?page_id=6&game-title=pzb054) and [Devices of a Mysterious and Insidious Nature](http://www.bigbadcon.com/?page_id=6&game-title=8eivil).

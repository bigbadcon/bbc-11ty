### Big Bad Con 2018 planning is underway!

Here's a few things we've already arranged:

- Contract with the Marriott signed. We're on for October 12-14.
- An extra day of the con! October 11 with will be pre-con day with open gaming, badge pickup, and some get-to-know-you special events!
- The hotel booking link and game submissions are underway.
- The 2017 feedback is in! Plans for improvements are posted below
- New art for Little Red and The Wolf has been commissioned from the amazing Eden Parkinson (who did our 2017 art). Can't wait to see what she cooks up!

Mark your calendars to be in Walnut Creek in October, it's going to be awesome!

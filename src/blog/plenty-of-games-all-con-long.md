Wow, those sign ups went quick! Have no fear though, we've got plenty of games still open. Two great ways to get more gaming action at Big Bad Con.

### Games on Demand

We've got 14 amazing GMs ready to throw down games every 2-4 hours in Boardroom II, all weekend long. Show up before games start, see who's offering what, and take your pick! Here's all the menus so you can see what's in store. Not all games will be offered at the same time, so if you absolutely gotta have something, we'll let you know when that GM is on duty.

### New Game Entries

After the first rush of sign ups, we looked at what games were the most in demand, and asked GMs to run more of them... and they did! Here's just a few of the games which, as of this posting, still have slots open:

[![A loaded lanyard](images/IMG_0040-225x300.jpg "A loaded lanyard")](http://www.bigbadcon.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_0040.jpg)The Wolf has been so busy crafting these pins, you'd think he had hijacked the elves (Nick, you've got nothing on me, paws don't leave prints).

You're going do awesome things at Big Bad Con, right? Like give food to charity? Like running games? Heck, just showing up at the front door makes you awesome. But where's the proof. How to set yourself apart from other posers who _say_ they were at Big Bad?

Achievement Unlocked: Pins!

Do cool things at the con and you'll get them. More? The Wolf has his own special award for folks who make him laugh, cry, or help catch little red.

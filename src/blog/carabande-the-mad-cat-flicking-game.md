[![David Gabriel](/images/DavidG_portrait.jpg "David Gabriel")](http://www.bigbadcon.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/DavidG_portrait.jpg)The illustrious David Gabriel is bringing Carabande and a host of other games to Big Bad Con.

"Ladies and gentlemen, start your fingers! Yes it is that time to play a convention favorite… Carabande! Easy to learn and fun for all ages. I will also have my famous “Convention Box 2.0” full of easy to learn and fun to play board games. So if you are at the show early and looking for something to play while waiting for other events to start, come on over and join in on the fun!" _\- David Gabriel_

David will be running games Friday from 1PM-8PM in open gaming just as the con is getting started. The event listing is [here](http://www.bigbadcon.com/?page_id=6&event_id=80)

KP, of KP11 Studios has made an incredible offer for all Big Bad Con attendees to take headshot photos at a discounted rate.

His normal rate for professional headshots is $400, but at Big Bad Con he's going to set up a studio and offer them to attendees for a discounted rate of $200. If you'd like to take advantage of this offer, KP has a form here that has more information and where you can sign up for a time slot to get your photos taken:

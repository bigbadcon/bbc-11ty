- Characters provided or created during play.
- Beginners welcome!

### Free admission requirements:

We love our GMs, facilitators, panelists, and volunteers. Youâ€™re the ones making Big Bad Con happen! To thank you for for contribution to the con, we offer free badges (4-day admission) to anyone who does **any combination of 8 hours or more of the following**:

- [Runs Events on the Schedule](/volunteer/run-a-game)
- [GMs in Games on Demand](/volunteer/be-a-god/)
- [Volunteers to Join the Rangers](/volunteer/join-the-wolf-pack/)

Note that if you are running RPGs, we strongly prefer 2-hour and 4-hour games.

If your event has room for 11 or more players/attendees, it counts for **double** the length (you only need 4 hours instead of 8)

When you make a lounge at a gaming convention, what do you put in it? Games, of course! With the introduction of the People of Colour (PoC) Lounge this year, Big Bad Con wanted to give back to our community, specifically by supporting PoC game designers. Our special events team put out a call for game submissions by PoC designers or majority PoC designer teams to include in our lounge. In this blog post we will share all of the submissions with you and let you know which games you can find in the PoC Lounge during Big Bad Con 2024! 

## Game Selection Process

A big thank you to everyone who submitted their own games or nominated their favorite ones. While we couldn’t buy them all, we’ve linked the games we were not able to feature in our Honorable Mentions section. 

To choose the games for the lounge, our PoC Lounge coordinator reviewed the submissions and excluded games that were too long (above 50 pages), were locked behind Patreon walls, or required other content that wouldn’t be available in the lounge. Once the shortlist was made, the coordinator invited PoC staff members to review the games and vote for the games they wanted to see in the lounge. You can see our voting instructions here:

Using this method, we are delighted to say we bought every single game that had at least one vote for it!

### [BUTT\&HEAD](https://www.dinoberrypress.com/shop/p/butt-and-head)

$20 - $24.99	PDF, Physical (Zine/Book)

You co-pilot a centaur! It's silly and lighthearted, and the system encourages players to freely communicate as the internal dialogue of their shared character and coordinate their strategy.

$5 - $9.99	PDF, Physical (Zine/Book)&#x9;

I love that it not only focuses on physical well being but also mental/emotional as well! Players have to care for one another in order to succeed in their adventures!

### [Everyday Heroes](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/397312/everyday-heroes-quickstart-guide)

### [Full Spectrum](https://ehronlime.itch.io/spectres-of-brocken-full-spectrum)

$5 - $9.99	PDF&#x9;

This needs the base game \[Spectres of Brocken] but offers the work by multiple bipoc creators using the core skeleton of spectres to add additional settings & their own internal narrative structure to explore the premise further. On top of that, each game has a different tone & channels different but connected perspectives on growing up, war & family.&#x9;

### [Houses of the Sun by Night](https://emilyzhu.itch.io/houses-of-the-sun-by-night)

$10 - $14.99	PDF&#x9;

Series of 13 minigames, incredible prose, WILD resolution mechanics (like using a clock face).

### [Into the Starlit Sky	](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/443550/Into-the-Starlit-Sky)

$5 - $9.99	PDF, Physical (Zine/Book)&#x9;

I chose Tarot cards over standard playing cards because I wanted the cards themselves (their titles and images) to add to the storytelling of the prompts and infuse some spiritual reflection into a story of sci-fi exploration.

$10 - $14.99	PDF&#x9;

You get to sing while playing!

$10 - $14.99	PDF&#x9;

A very fun romp through the context of messy dramatic telenovelas. The game can be a great ice breaker. Quick, easy to build characters, materials facilitate q chosen shared setting, the game is rules light, easy to pick up & fun for single sessions.  Huge replayability.

The worldbuilding process through with players create their family, home, and town.

### [Ship of Theseus](https://metaparadox.itch.io/ship-of-theseus)

$5 - $9.99	PDF&#x9;

It is a LARP about transhumanism, but not mainstream transhumanism. It is a transhumanist LARP that is heavily influenced by my experiences as a queer, nonbinary, chronically ill, neurodivergent person.

### [Spectres of Brocken](https://ehronlime.itch.io/spectres-of-brocken)

$20 - $24.99	PDF, Physical (Zine/Book)

The book is a great visual guide and the game itself is emotional, quick, emergent, it uses great design tech to carry the tone and theme. Great work by Aaron Lim at building up a love letter to things he loves by sharing the parts of them he enjoys with people who play ttrpgs.

### [The Between](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/360858/the-between)

Pay What You Want	PDF&#x9;

This game is written by a queer latino man, it's very queer and PoC focused, and it's currently on sale for Pay What You Want as a hype up to the upcoming kickstarter. It's a bit long, I know, but most of the book is the modules, advanced tips, etc. 

### [The Kobold Grinder	](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/400909/the-kobold-grinder)

What You Want	PDF&#x9;

It encourages you to do research to play the game.

I love how much of the narrative is given to the player.

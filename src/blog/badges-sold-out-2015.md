Hard to imagine but The Wolf, Little Red, and Grandma's house are all filled up.

We've limited the number of badges available to ensure that everyone who does attend the con can have a full schedule of games and that we're not overbooking the event.

After the quota is lifted on 9/19 and everyone has had a chance to get their fill of games, we'll re-evaluate the current cap and see if there are room for a few more attendees. If you'd like to be on a wait list to buy a badge then, please comment below.

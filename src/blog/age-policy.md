![Teen Games & Events](/images/teen-games.gif)We welcome all teens from 13-17 years old to attend Big Bad Con 2018. We are happy to announce the new [Teen Games & Events Track](http://www.bigbadcon.com/events/categories/teens/) for young gamers! Big Bad Con supports roleplaying games for all ages. We believe that young gamers need age-appropriate games, and all gamers should play in an environment where they feel comfortable expressing themselves freely.

To attend teens will need a [permission form](https://www.bigbadcon.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Teen-permission-form.pdf) signed by a parent or guardian. This can be filled out in advance or at the con!

## Hotel Age Requirements

All guests ages 13-20 must be accompanied by an adult who is 21 or older when checking in. All guests ages 13-14 must be attended to by an adult who is 21 or older throughout their stay.

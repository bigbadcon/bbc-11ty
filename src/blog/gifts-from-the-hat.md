[![](/images/120920-191419-300x225.jpg "120920-191419")](http://www.bigbadcon.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/120920-191419.jpg)Fred Hick, and all of Evil Hat for that matter is made of awesome. It's been said before, but it's worth repeating now. As just another example of that awesome, Evil Hat just sent me a stack of these sweet shirts for the staff and GM running in the [Evil Hat room](http://www.bigbadcon.com/little-red-hangs-up-her-hood-for-an-evil-hat/ "Little Red hangs up her hood for an Evil Hat"). The only thing he could have done that would have been more awesome was send a super-intelligent ape to atten the con in one of these shirts.... wait Fred... don't get any ideas... the shirts are great as is!

The Wolf and Little Red send many thanks for these Evil Threads!

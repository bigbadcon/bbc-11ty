This year, we have united the powerhouses of our POC Programming Track and our Big Bad Con Scholarship program! Bringing these two scholarship programs together will allow us to continue our work to support POCs at Big Bad Con through financial aid, an industry meet and greet event, and the opportunity to spend a weekend with an international community.

Here is the programming for 2024:

## POC Scholarship

Working with individual and industry donors we hope to raise $50,000+ to aid people of color from around the world in attending the con by paying for travel, boarding, admission, and related expenses.

## POC Meet & Greet

We're also hosting another meet and greet for POC writers, artists, editors, and creators to their fellow peers and industry contacts. Non-POC industry attendees will also be invited with the specific goal to offer mentorship, publishing, or employment opportunities to the attendees of color.

## Office Hours

Following on the success of the office hours facilitated for us by the excellent folks over at Pixel Circus during our Big Bad Online event, we will be offering our industry attendees conference rooms to meet with interested attendees who would like to connect directly with them. This will expand upon the opportunities of the Meet & Greet, providing additional time and flexibility for our POC Scholars to build connections and explore professional opportunities.

## Sponsors

Several generous sponsors have made individual and corporate contributions to make our POC Programming possible. Their support of transformative change in games is so important, and we are grateful for their generous contributions. We would like to add a special thanks to our major donors:

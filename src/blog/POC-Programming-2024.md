This year, we have united the powerhouses of our POC Programming Track and our Big Bad Con Scholarship program! Bringing these two scholarship programs together will allow us to continue our work to support POCs at Big Bad Con through financial aid, an industry meet and greet event, and the opportunity to spend a weekend with an international community.

We will be updating this post with more detail and information:

## Scholarship Funds for POCs

Working with individual and industry donors we hope to raise $75,000+ to aid people of color from around the world in attending the con by paying for travel, boarding, admission, and related expenses. These funds will be distributed through our Big Bad Con Scholarship to POC applicants. 

## POC Meet & Greet

We're hosting a Meet & Greet for POC writers, artists, editors, and creators to interact with their fellow peers and industry contacts. Non-POC industry attendees will also be invited with the specific goal to offer mentorship, publishing, or employment opportunities to the attendees of color.

## Office Hours

Following on the success of the virtual office hours facilitated for us by the excellent folks over at [Pixel Circus](https://www.twitch.tv/pixelcircus/) during our [Big Bad Online](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLY22glPJVwSJHx2z80YFb1h9Md-cZmZM0) event, we will be offering our industry attendees conference rooms to meet with interested attendees who would like to connect directly with them. This will expand upon the opportunities of the Meet & Greet, providing additional time and flexibility for our scholarship recipients of color to build connections and explore professional opportunities.

## POC Lounge

This year we're adding a new POC Lounge, as a space available to all POC attendees throughout the con to connect, relax, and socialize. We are hosting this space in place of the POC Dinner, an event that we deeply valued but which, due to the presence of food, placed an undue burden of risk on our POC attendees. The POC Lounge will be a masking-required space, as are all con spaces and events this year.

## Sponsors

Thank you to all of our sponsors! Their support of transformative change in games is so important, and we are grateful for their generous contributions. Our crowdfunding and fundraising efforts are starting in May 2024, and we look forward to listing them here as they are added to our list for this year.

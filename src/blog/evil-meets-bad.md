[![evil_hat](/images/evil_hat.jpg)](http://www.bigbadcon.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/evil_hat.jpg)Welcome back Evil Hat, meet Big Bad Con 2013!

For every Evil Hatter out there you will be happy to know that Evil Hat's presence at Big Bad Con will be greater than ever before.

### Evil Hat Room

Like last year, Evil Hat will have it's own private room, and The Wolf still has some Evil Hat T-shirts to give out to GMs running in it. Last year we had a [Fist Full of Games](http://www.bigbadcon.com/little-red-hangs-up-her-hood-for-an-evil-hat/) in the Evil Hat room, this year we're shooting for more!

### Heroes of The Hat

Legendary heroes of the Hat like Lenny Balsera, Chris Hanrahan, Morgan Ellis and more will be at Big Bad Con running games, judging games, hocking wares, and who knows what else.

### Big Bad GM - Fate Core

With the upcoming release of [Fate Core](http://www.evilhat.com/home/fate-core/ "Fate Core") this year Big Bad GM contestants will be running their games using Fate Core, and the winner will receive (in addition to a shiny pin and bragging rights) a signed copy of the game.

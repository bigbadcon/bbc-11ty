Hi all,

Last year in April we decided to cancel Big Bad Con 2020 and that turned out to be the correct (and necessary) decision. Though vaccination in the US is proceeding ahead of schedule, we’re once again trying to predict what an in-person convention would look like in October (our hotel contract is for **October 21-24**).

The Big Bad Con board members and staff have been talking about the possibility since January and have agreed to make our final decision about hosting an in-person and/or online event in early May based on the following criteria:

* Our own research, experience, and sense of safety and feasibility.
* Guidelines from the CDC and WHO.
* State, city, and Hyatt hotel specific requirements.
* Input from you, our friends, loved ones, and would-be fellow gamers!

To address that last point, we’ve created a [**Google Feedback Form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdPLMy7WrllnFaj-2O0dYZ9URaXzHUDSFuY9eo0laOlLZLppA/viewform) that is open from now until 4/30. We’re evaluating in-person, online, and hybrid options. If you’re thinking about coming to Big Bad Con this year, please let us know what you think. We very much want to see all of you, but we want to make the accommodations needed to do so safely and to counteract the increased economic disparity caused by the pandemic.

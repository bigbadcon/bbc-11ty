The Wolf is putting on his stethoscope to do some good in the world.  He feels guilty after all the houses he's blown down and grandmothers he has eaten.

As of today it is official, Big Bad Con is a charity event.  Here are are the charities it will support, and how!

[![Doctors Without Borders](images/msf-logo-header.jpg "Doctors Without Borders")](http://www.bigbadcon.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/msf-logo-header.jpg) Poceeds from the convention will go to [Doctors Without Borders](http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/).  Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is an international medical humanitarian organization working in nearly 70 countries to assist people whose survival is threatened by violence, neglect, or catastrophe.  In 1999, MSF received the Nobel Peace Prize.

So, if you pay to attend Big Bad Con, you get to game AND help people in need. You are an action hero!

[![](/images/header_logo_home.gif "Alemeda County Food Bank")](http://www.bigbadcon.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/header_logo_home.gif) The Woodsman is going to round up a barrel to fill with non-perishable foods for the [Alameda County Food Bank](http://www.accfb.org/).  The ACFB has a network of 275 strategically placed member agencies – food pantries, soup kitchens, child-care centers, senior centers, after-school programs and other community-based organizations – the Food Bank distributes enough food for 300,000 meals weekly.

Not only will you feel good knowing that your old can of bean is feeding someone who needs it, but the The Wolf is also giving out "Feed The Wolf" achievement pins to anyone who donates!

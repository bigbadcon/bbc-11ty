[![Grandma's House](images/62608_1-300x198.jpg "Oakland Airport Hilton")](http://www.bigbadcon.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/62608_1.jpg)Hey all, rooms are now available for Big Bad Con!

[Book now!](http://www.hilton.com/en/hi/groups/personalized/O/OAKHIHH-BBC-20121005/index.jhtml?WT.mc_id=POG)

Benefits of having a room include being closer to the games, license to drink without worrying about driving, helping out the con (we need 50 rooms booked to put on the event), and this year, a special perk - An "I slept in Grandma's House" pin. To claim your special prize, book a room and then comment below letting me know you did. I'll have the pin already attached on your lanyard when you show up for the con!

For more information on the hotel, and eating in the area, check out the [Hotel Info](http://www.bigbadcon.com/?page_id=192 "Hotel") page.

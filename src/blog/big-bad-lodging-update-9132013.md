[![Grandma's House](/images/62608_1-300x198.jpg)](http://www.bigbadcon.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/62608_1.jpg)We have rooms! Fifteen (15) rooms have been added to the block! As expected they don't have the full con discount, but they are still lower than the standard hotel rate. Enough so you can afford to buy the The Wolf a drink or two!

The new block is available Friday - Monday for $129/night. [Click here to book at the the con rate](http://www.hilton.com/en/hi/groups/personalized/O/OAKHIHH-BBC-20131004/index.jhtml?WT.mc_id=POG), or call 510-635-5000 and used group code BBC.

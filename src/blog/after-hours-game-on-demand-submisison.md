Little Red is ready to throw some dice and she's asking just one question: Have you got game?

We're looking for GMs to run in the Games On Demand room for the Goats Gruff and possibly a few other adventurous players. Run eight (8) hours or more and you get a free badge! This year we're asking for two different games you can run, and we'll make badges for each of them ([example](http://www.bigbadcon.com/games-on-demand-badges-courtesy-bully-pulpit/ "Games On Demand Badges â€“ Courtesy Bully Pulpit")). If you would like to offer four games, submit the form twice.

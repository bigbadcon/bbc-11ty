![logo-envoy](/images/logo-envoy-300x112.png)The wonderful folks at [Double Exposure and their Envoy program](http://www.dexposure.com/envoy/) are bringing Big Bad Con a Social Deduction Room, featuring play-to-win copies of Ultimate Werewolf, One Night, The Resistance, and Coup, sponsored by [Bezier Games](http://beziergames.com/) and [Indie Boards & Cards](http://www.indieboardsandcards.com/).

By day we'll be playing the shorter games. By night we'll be playing the longer and larger Ultimate Werewolf!

## Friday, October 1 2021
We’ll be kicking things off on Friday, October 1 at 5:30 PM Pacific with our “lobby con” social gathering and check-in event.

We urge **everyoneI* to attend if possible, as the more people we can get checked in on Friday, the less time we have to spend on Saturday and Sunday with check-ins before we start the donuts. The Friday event will run at least until 8:30 PM.

(Friday’s lobby con is free to attend with a purchased or sponsored ticket for Saturday or Sunday.)

## Saturday, October 2 and Sunday, October 3 2021
Saturday and Sunday will have the same schedule:

* **Morning Donut Session:** 11:00 AM - 3:30 PM PST
* **Evening Donut Session:** 5:00 PM - 9:00 PM PST

We’re still figuring out whether we’ll need to have a hard stop at 9:00 PM or if we can allow games to run later.

## Multiple Donuts
As we mentioned in our previous post about how the event will work, we can manage up to about 35 people in a donut, so if we have more attendees than that, we will open up a second track starting an hour apart. If it looks like we'll need to do that, we will inform attendees in advance of any schedule changes.

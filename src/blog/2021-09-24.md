We’ll be kicking things off on Friday, October 1 at 5:30 PM Pacific with our “lobby con” social gathering and check-in event. We do urge everyone* to attend if possible, as the more people we can get checked in on Friday, the less time we have to spend on Saturday and Sunday with check-ins before we start the donuts. The Friday event will run at least until 8:30 PM. *(Friday’s lobby con is free to attend with a purchased or sponsored ticket for Saturday or Sunday.)

Saturday October 2 and Sunday October 3 will have similar schedules. The morning donut will begin at 11:00 AM Pacific with gaming time running until 3:30 PM, and the evening donut will begin at 5:00 PM Pacific with gaming time running until at least 9:00 PM—we’re still figuring out whether we’ll need to have a hard stop at that time or can allow games to run later.

As we mentioned in our previous post about how the event will work, we can manage up to about 35 people in a donut, so if we have more attendees than that, we will open up a second track starting an hour apart. We’ll post in advance of the event if it looks like that will be necessary, and email attendees to notify you of any schedule changes.

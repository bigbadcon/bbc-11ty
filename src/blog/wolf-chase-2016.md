Every year at Big Bad Con, gamers will be faced with decisions such as can I outrun this creature bearing down on me with vicious claws and gnashing teeth? Usually these questions are solved by a roll of the dice. But some gamers decide to really test it by getting up with the sun and running for real in the Wolf Chase!

This [Wolf Chase 2016](http://www.bigbadcon.com/events/wolf-chase-2016/) is on Sunday 16th from 7-8am. There are two courses the running course and the walking course — because hey you might need practice walking away from the slow zeds.

## Support the runners! Support Doctors without Borders!

Can’t make the run but want to support the runners? Want to help doctors save lives all over the world? Heck yeah you do, check out our [Crowdrise campaign](https://www.crowdrise.com/wolf-run-2016)!

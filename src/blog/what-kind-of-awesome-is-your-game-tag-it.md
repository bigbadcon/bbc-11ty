<!-- img.aligncenter, img.alignright, img.alignleft { background: none; border: 0px solid #DDDDDD; padding: 4px; text-align: center; } -->[![con-facing-left.fw](/images/con-facing-left.fw_-202x300.png)](http://www.bigbadcon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/con-facing-left.fw_.png)Inspired by [Stuart Robertson's GM badges](http://strangemagic.robertsongames.com/2011/08/gm-merit-badges.html), The Goats Gruff have added something new to the game listings at Big Bad Con: Game tags!

**What do these do?** - These allow the GMs to give would-be players more information about their game. Is the game focused on [investigation](http://www.bigbadcon.com/events/tags/investigation/), [combat](http://www.bigbadcon.com/events/tags/combat/), [intrigue](http://www.bigbadcon.com/events/tags/intrigue/)? Some of all three? If it's mature, is that because of [graphic violence](http://www.bigbadcon.com/events/tags/graphic-violence/), because of [sexuality](http://www.bigbadcon.com/events/tags/sex-and-sexuality/), or something else?

When you know more about the games, you're better able to pick games suited to you!

**What else?** The Goats decided to go with tags (rather than badges) because this way they are also searchable. Find one game that is filled with _intrigue_ and want to find more? Click on the tag link to see others. Just like this... [http://www.bigbadcon.com/events/tags/intrigue/](http://www.bigbadcon.com/events/tags/intrigue/)

- Jason Morningstar brings his wonderfully odd gaming sensibility with [Apportionment](http://www.bigbadcon.com/events/apportionment/), a "Freeform Committee larp" sequel to Sirai Civil War and an epic 16 player four table game of The Warren called [Grand Warren](http://www.bigbadcon.com/events/the-grand-warren/).

## All this is awesome but when is game sign up?

Game sign up for Big Bad Con 2016 will start in mid September. This year we will be rolling out game signups in three phases:

- Phase I (9/10 at noon PST) — everyone is allowed to sign up to a maximum of 2 games
- Phase II (9/17 at noon PST) — everyone is allowed to sign up to a maximum of 4 games
- Phase III (9/24 at noon PST) — game signups limited only by your schedule, game availability, and your ability to time travel or clone yourself\*

_\* Time travelers with separate instances of themselves must each purchase separate passes to Big Bad Con. Android clones must show that they are at least level 6 Turing compliant and present an official Asimov law certificate to come to Big Bad Con. Biological clones must swear under oath that they have never seen a David Cronenberg film._

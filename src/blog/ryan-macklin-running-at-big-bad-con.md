[![](/images/ryan_macklin1.jpg "ryan_macklin")](http://www.bigbadcon.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/ryan_macklin1.jpg)Ryan Macklin, friend of The Wolf (we've both spent time under the Woodsman's axe), and immanent creature of the Internet, will be packing his backs and coming back to Oakland to game with us at Big Bad Con. So far this is what we've got on the schedule from Ryan:

[THOR MUST DIE!](http://www.bigbadcon.com/events/thor-must-die-2012/ "THOR MUST DIE!") - Are you ready to end a Myth? Can you stop becoming one yourself. Let's kill THOR!

[Emerging Threats Unit](http://www.bigbadcon.com/events/emerging-threats-unit/ "Emerging Threats Unit") Welcome to the secret paramilitary wing of the Centers for Disease Control â€” the Emerging Threats Unit.

Who knows what else Mr. Macklin might have up his sleeve for his October homecoming.

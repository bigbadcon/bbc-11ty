We've signed the contract and we're very excited to announce the dates and location for Big Bad Con 2020!

**October 22-25** **Hyatt Regency San Francisco Airport** **1333 Old Bayshore Hwy** **Burlingame, CA 94010**

2019 was our biggest and best year ever. Between the Babble On Equity Project, the scholarship program, and the Kickstarter stretch goal guests we gave financial and logistical assistance to over 70 folks to help them attend Big Bad Con. We had over 600 events and nearly 1,000 attendees. The POC Meet & Greet was an enormously successful industry event that helped several folks find mentoring, freelance work, and even full time jobs.

2019 was also the year that we stretched into every available space the Walnut Creek Marriott had to offer, and even then there were times when folks couldn't find a table to play a game or sit and chat. This year in reviewing our past growth we realized we either needed to cap our attendance and allow fewer folks than attended in 2019 (shrinking the con) or find a new location that could sustain our growth. When reviewing locations we evaluated them based on the following factors:

- Guest room rate
- Parking fees
- Event space available
- Cost to the convention
- Available social gathering spaces
- Food availability (in the hotel, nearby, and delivery)
- Physical accessibility
- Likelihood of maintaining power from PG&E
- Eagerness of the hotel staff to host a convention

After several months of reviewing the attendee feedback, meeting with the board and with the staff, we signed a contract with theÂ Hyatt Regency San Francisco Airport, which offered us the best room rates for our attendees, has over four times the event space that the Marriott does, regularly works with gaming conventions, and is thrilled to have us.

### What's next

With the hotel settled, we still have a lot of work to do to prepare for the Kickstarter, event submission, and the growth and development of the con. In the coming months, we'll send out updates as all of these come together.

This year will be Big Bad Con 10. We're filled with hope and excitement for what's to come!

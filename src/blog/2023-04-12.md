Weâ€™re excited to finally reveal what weâ€™ve been teasing for more than a month: the dates of our first in-person convention in 4 years. Go Play NW 2023 will be hosted on July 7â€“9 at the Centilia Cultural Center in the Mount Baker neighborhood of sunny (ðŸ˜‰) Seattle, WA. [Registration](/register) for this event will open April 17 at 3AM PDT. 

Weâ€™re taking COVID safety as seriously as we can for our return to in-person. That means KN-95 level or higher masks will be required in all indoor spaces and recommended for outdoor spaces. Donâ€™t worry: if you forget your mask, weâ€™ll provide one for you! You can find out more about this and all the other steps weâ€™re taking to keep our attendees safe by reading our [2023 COVID-19 Policies](/covid-19) 

Our new venue, the Centilia Cultural Center, is an event space connected to El Centro de la Raza, a storied Latino community-building organization founded in 1972. Unlike our prior venue, the Cultural Center does not have lodgings available on location. However, it is very accessible via public transit, a block away from the Mount Baker Transit Center. You can read more about [El Centro de la Raza and Centilia](/venue) at their website: https://www.elcentrodelaraza.org/.

Last, but certainly not least, for all of you who canâ€™t make it in-person: weâ€™re not leaving you behind, and we havenâ€™t forgotten you. Our online event will be happening October 27â€“29, 2023, so mark your calendars now. Weâ€™ll have the Featured Facilitators, Donut, and scheduled games programming you know and love, so tell your friends! Tell your cats! Tell your dog! And watch this space for more details.

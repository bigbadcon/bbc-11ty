## Thanks to our sponsors

We are so excited to open games registration. There is such an amazing list of games and events this year. We want to thank all of our donors for supporting our kickstarter. We also want to thank this year’s generous sponsors [Bully Pulpit Games](http://bullypulpitgames.com/) and [Evil Hat](https://www.evilhat.com/home/) for helping support Big Bad Con 2017!

[Make sure to register your badge before registration begins!](https://www.bigbadcon.com/events/verify-your-2017-big-bad-con-badge/) During the first week of game registration you are limited to signing up for only 2 games. On Sept 23rd this opens up to 4 games and Sept 30th it opens up fully with no maximum.

In years past, we have sometimes had issues with the game registration due to the horde of everyone trying to register at the same time. We think we have fixed most of the issues on the backend but please bare with us if you run into trouble. You can follow us for any updates on twitter: [@bigbadcon](https://twitter.com/bigbadcon).

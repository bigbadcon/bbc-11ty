**Update: " 4 more rooms freed up!**

The good news is that we're hitting all our numbers and filling up rooms at the hotel. The bad news is some people still want to stay and we've booked **almost** every double room in the hotel!

If you are looking for a single king bed or a room with two doubles book at the con rate ($95/night) at the Hilton: [Book Here](http://www.hilton.com/en/hi/groups/personalized/O/OAKHIHH-BBC-20121005/index.jhtml?WT.mc_id=POG "King Beds available").

As of this update (11AM PST 10/18) we have three rooms with double bed and three rooms with king beds left. Get them while you can!

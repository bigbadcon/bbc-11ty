Hello all,

First off, many thanks for [all your support](http://www.bigbadcon.com/big-bad-con-2016-hotel-hunt-is-on/). I got a flood of emails, tweets, and personal calls from folks who wanted to help us find a new home. And it worked!

We've been talking with the [Walnut Creek Marriott](http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/oakwc-walnut-creek-marriott/) and it looks like they could be our new home for 2016 and on! I toured the hotel and loved it.

### The Perks

- It's very close to BART. A 10-minute walk or a call to the hotel for a shuttle will get you there fast.
- The space is just beautiful. See the pictures below. It's a open floor plan with tons of little nooks for socializing. We've got board rooms big and small that can be partitioned off as needed, _and_ with cool service passages between them, aka Jefferies tubes.
- The bathrooms in the gaming areas are all ours! They will be all-gender access for the duration of the con.
- 4,000 additional square feet including room for an exciting new addition to the con, to be announced soon!
- 20 private game rooms--up from 18 at the Hilton last year.
- Food! So many food options. In addition to the hotel's own breakfast buffet, there are a dozen restaurants within a few blocks, and over 100 within a 3 mile radius. Even better, the complimentary hotel shuttle will drive you to any of them. I found a place 100 feet from the door that serves up a tasty breakfast burrito for $4.50. Not bad!
- The hotel is willing to draft a contract for 2016Â as well as hold the space for 2017 so there would be no surprise increases next year.
- A full bar in the lobby, open from 11AM to midnight.
- Free Wi-Fi for all guests.

### Here's what it will cost us. For the attendees:

- Reduced room rates for con attendees at $129/night.
- Parking is $10/day. That's been negotiated down from their standard $23 daily fee. It's also valet parking, so you don't have to hunt for a spot!

### For the con:

- The space is roughly $3,500 more than the Hilton was. This is dramatically lower than quotes from other Bay Area hotels, _and_ it includes more space and 20 private gaming rooms, so we're getting more out of it!

This year we're excited to host our first POC dinner at Big Bad Con. In the tradition of WisCon, this dinner will be an opportunity to meet and mingle with other amazing people of color.

### Sponsors

Several generous sponsors have made individual contributions to ensure that all of the people of color coming to Big Bad Con as stretch goal guests, BOEP recipients, or staff will have free admission to the dinner. They've also helped subsidize the cost for our other attendees of color, bringing the dinner price down from $45 to $20 a seat. We want to thank all of these folks for their generous donations: Ajit George, Whitney “Strix” Beltrán, Shervyn von Hoerl, John Stavropoulos, James Stuart, Sara Williamson, Monte Cook Games, Doug Levandowski, Nathan Weisman, Aljernon Bolden, Ryan Schapals, Kitty Stoholski, Shane Liebling, Pandasaurus Games, Banana Chan, and contributors to the Babble On Equity Project.

### Dinner Information

**Location**: Creek House Dim Sum (1291 Parkside Drive, Walnut Creek) **Date and Time**: Friday October 11 from 6-8PM **Fare**: Chinese/Dim Sum including vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options. Attendees must be 18 or older.

### Update 10/1: More space available

Due to a last minute closure of the original venue we changed venues to a larger location, which means we have 10 more spots available, but we have to confirm them in the next few days. If you'd like to attend the POC dinner, sign up before 10/4.

### Update 10/3: Sold out

That went fast! The last few spots are full. It should be a great time!

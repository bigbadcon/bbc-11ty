We’re excited to announce our first online Go Play NW event for 2022 will be the weekend of Friday June 3 through Sunday June 5! Like our previous event in 2021, we’ll be using a dedicated Discord server as our base of operations, and we’ll be able to have video, audio-only, and text-only channels for hosting the games.

For this event, we’ll be organizing games in two ways: each session we’ll be holding the pitch circle known as “the donut,” which is great for getting people into games on the spur of the moment; and we’ll also have a scheduling system set up on our website, for those of you who like to plan a game in advance and know that you’ll have players already at the table when the session starts.

As before, the event will kick off with a social gathering on Friday evening that will give you time to catch up with old friends and meet new ones, and give us time to get everyone checked in for the weekend. Then on Saturday and Sunday we’ll have the game sessions.

In the next couple weeks, we’ll be ready to open up registration, and we’ll have further details on scheduling games in advance shortly after that. For now, save the dates Friday June 3 through Sunday June 5, and start thinking about the games you’d like to play! We hope you’ll join us!

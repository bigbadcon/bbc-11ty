We’ve been hard at work the past several months curating an online event that all of the Big Bad Community can be proud of. All of us immediately realized that this event is a unique opportunity for us to bring together many diverse and powerful voices.

Big Bad Online is a welcoming community gathering and a platform for game designers and professionals from all over the world to share their knowledge, creativity, and insight. We are very excited about this event as the caliber of panels and seminars we’re presenting are on par with professional industry events.

We've released a sneak peek of three of our favorite events on our [Events](/events/) page — it was honestly hard to pick just three as there are so many good ones! More events will be released over the coming days as the event gets closer.

As we want this vital information to be shared with all, Big Bad Online will be free to all attendees. Our Mightycause fundraiser will go to paying all of our speakers and raising money to support the future of Big Bad Con.

We have a lot of grand ideas for Big Bad Con 2022 and beyond. This fundraiser is your chance to show you support for everything you have always loved about Big Bad Con and the amazing potential it has.

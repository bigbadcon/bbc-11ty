**Our Four Big Bad GM Contestants**: Mike Bogan, Matt Steele, Michael Garcia, and Scott White. Each of these GMs received hoards of accolades for their games last year, and as the most nominated of the GMs, they have all been invited to complete in this year’s Big Bad GM. They are also all running additional games besides competing.

And this is just to name a few of the amazing GMs we have at Big Bad Con. Others on this list include Shannon MacNamara,  Morgan Ellis, Sean Schoonmaker, Daniel Hodges, Noam Rosen, Alan Hodges, Rich Taylor, Lalita Devi, Mattea Ezgar, Karen Twelves, Duane O'Brien, and more.

Given this list, you can rest assured that Big Bad Con wll be filled to the brim with awesome game masters. So awesome in fact, that the best GMs of the con are nominated by their players to compete in the following year’s Big Bad GM (and Iron Chef style competition for GMs).

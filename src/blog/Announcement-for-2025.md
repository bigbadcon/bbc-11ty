After careful consideration, the Board, Leadership, and our Staff have concluded that we are unable to host our in-person convention this year. We discussed this thoroughly and this decision was not reached lightly. Our volunteer Staff and Rangers exceeded expectations in organizing last yearâ€™s convention. We thank them for their hard work.

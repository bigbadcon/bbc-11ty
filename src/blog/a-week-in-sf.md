Come hang out in the Bay Area the week before Big Bad Con! We’re organizing activities in San Francisco and East Bay from Tuesday, October 10th through Thursday the 12th.

There will be talks, games, exploring the city, casual hangouts, hikes, and more. If you’re coming from out of town, fly in a few days early; if you’re local, share your city with the visitors and get in more time with some great gamers.

Most events will be free, with no advanced commitment required. You're welcome to drop in and out of events as is convenient.

If there’s even a remote chance you’ll come, drop us a line at [aweekinsf@gmail.com](mailto:aweekinsf@gmail.com) with your name and what times you expect to be there. Knowing the rough numbers of people interested is key for helping us to plan the event.

If you want to be extra helpful please fill out [this form](https://bit.ly/AWeekinSF2017Survey) so we can know what types of activities are most exciting to you!

Sending us an email or filling out the form is the best way to keep informed as the schedule evolves. We'll reach out with specifics as it gets closer.

Can't wait to see you all, **A Week in SF organizers** James Stuart, Hakan Seyalioglu, J Li, Randy Lubin

Joe Mcdaldno makes games (_Ribbon Drive, Perfect Unrevised, Monsterhearts_) that are [Buried without Ceremony](http://buriedwithoutceremony.com/). Jackson Tegu makes games (_Silver and White, Slammin', Kaleidoscope, Tower of Hats_) that are [Photographs of Lightning](http://www.photographsoflightning.com/). Together, they will have a special place at Big Bad Con: The **Buried without Lightning** Room!

Here are some of the awesome games that they and others will run in the BwL room:

* [Silver and White](http://www.bigbadcon.com/events/silver-and-white/ "Silver and White") - Four suburban teenagers encounter the mystery that will shape their lives.
* [Monsterhearts](http://www.bigbadcon.com/events/monsterhearts/ "Monsterhearts") - Monsterhearts lets you and your friends create stories about sexy monsters, creeping horror, messy love triangles, and teenage angst.
* [The Quiet Year](http://www.bigbadcon.com/events/the-quiet-year-01/ "The Quiet Year") - The Quiet Year is a map game. You define the struggles of a post-apocalyptic community, and attempt to build something good within their quiet year.
* [The Quiet Year](http://www.bigbadcon.com/events/the-quiet-year-02/ "The Quiet Year") - The Quiet Year is a map game. You define the struggles of a post-apocalyptic community, and attempt to build something good within their quiet year.

To fly this far south though, Joe and Jackson need a little help. If you're excited to see these beautiful creatures and play their beautiful games, consider helping them fund their flight.

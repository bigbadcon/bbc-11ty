[![ImprovForGamers](/images/ImprovForGamers_4-228x300.jpg "ImprovForGamers")](http://www.bigbadcon.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/ImprovForGamers_4.jpg)Improv theater teaches many skills that can make your game rock: collaboration, embracing failure, and generally feeling comfortable looking stupid. Yet, there is a divide to cross to get the gamer onto the stage. So Big Bad Con has brought the mountain to Mohammed. Come to the workshop and you're going to explore dynamic characters, collaborative scene-building, and the success/complication model as it applies to role-playing games.

The workshop will be led by local improv instructor Mia Blankensop with co-organizers Karen Twelves and Matthew Klein.

“I had a great time, and now I have a fabulous vehicle for introducing my wife to gaming!” – _Sean S._

“One of the best gaming experiences ever.” – _Eric Z._

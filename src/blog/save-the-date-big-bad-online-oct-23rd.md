Big Bad Online will be a one day (24 hour) event focusing on giving our community a place to gather and share. We’ll be hosting panels and seminars featuring a diverse mix of game designers and other creatives in the extended community.

**Big Bad Online will be free!** Panels and seminars will be streamed on Twitch and we will have an open “lobby con” on a special one day only Big Bad Online Discord. We will not be scheduling games at Big Bad Online though folks will of course be free to start their own impromptu games in Discord rooms.

To cover the costs of paying our speakers and cover our upkeep costs we’ll be running a fundraising campaign, starting in mid August. More about the fundraiser and our panels will be forthcoming in mid August so stay tuned by following our twitter [@bigbadcon](https://twitter.com/bigbadcon) or signing up on [our site](https://www.bigbadcon.com/) so you can be added to our mailing list!

**Details:**

* Date: October 23 12PM PT to October 24 12PM PT
* Cost to attend: Free!
* Format: Panels and seminars hosted on Twitch. Hangouts in Discord.
* More coming in August!

[![extra-life-logo](/images/extra-life-logo.jpg)](/images/extra-life-logo.jpg)You're coming to Big Bad Con! Awesome. Here are some important Con 101 reminders:

### Before you head out

**Bring non-perishable food for donation.** Big Bad Con will have a food barrel for the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano County at the registration desk. Please bring a can of something tasty for all the hungry folks in the Bay and we'll give you a pin! Here is a [list of food](/images/food-drive-shop-list.pdf) they are looking for.

### Getting to the Hotel

**Driving**: The Marriott in downtown Walnut Creek is off Interstate 680. [Here are driving directions](https://goo.gl/maps/KNj3fCYs5eK2). **Flying:** Both the Oakland International Airport (OAK) and San Francisco International Airport (SFO) are attached to BART (our subway system), so you can hop on a train and go to the **Walnut Creek** S**tation**. **Public Transportation**: We recommend taking BART to get to the Hotel. The **Walnut Creek Station** is a 12-minute walk, or you can call the hotel shuttle service (at 925-934-2000) for a pickup.

### At the con

**Hungry?** The hotel resturant and bar are quite good, but there are also plenty of good eats nearby. See the [map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1GrGZs5Giz4YFuxLwY4hDoEshZdY&hl=en_US).

**Where to go?** The convention registration desk is downstairs at level B2. You can take an an elevator from the main lobby or walk down the steps near the bar. There is a map of the building on the [hotel page](http://www.bigbadcon.com/?page_id=192 "Hotel").

**Parking.** Parking is valet only. The normal rate is $23/day but we have it reduced to $10/day for convention guests. Make sure the let the valet know that you're with the con when you arrive.

**Internet.** There are two WiFi Networks available (one works better in the hotel lobby and guest rooms, another is stronger in the convention area), both of which are free to use.

**Registration**: If you signed up before Oct 5 your badge will be ready for you at the door. If not weekend passes are $50 and one day passes are $25. Teen weekend passes are $30 and $15 respectively. You can purchase these at the con registration desk.

### Games

**Sign-ups:**  Online game sign-ups are closed. To get into any games at the con, check out the game sheet at the registration desk (Under the "Wolf Den" Banner) and put your name down in an open slot. Like we did it on the website, all open games will be first come, first served. The current day’s games will be posted on the wall, and updated for the next day at 8PM.

**Games on Demand**: Stop by California Ballroom Salon B and play in any of the Games on Demand Games as they open up. The organizers will post available game times, systems, and GMs inside the boardroom. Start times are [here](http://www.bigbadcon.com/games-on-demand/), but remember to show up about 10 minutes early to get in a game.

**Open Gaming:** All the game slots full and nothing to? Head over to Open Gaming, where we'll have awesome pick-up games available all weekend!

### Community Standards

**Policy**: Everyone at the con (attendees, volunteers, vendors, staff, and GMs) must adhere to the [Community Standards](http://www.bigbadcon.com/community-standards/) policy.

**Age Policy:** The con is open to all attendees 13 and older. Guests 13-17 will need waiver signed by a parent or guardian when they pick up their badge. More information [here](http://www.bigbadcon.com/age-policy/).

### Surviving at the Con

**3-2-1.** In the excitement of gaming it is easy to forget some of the basics. The 3-2-1 con rule is a reminder to get a minimum of 3 hours of sleep, 2 meals, and 1 shower each day.

**Up for little exercise?** The [Wolf Chase 201](http://www.bigbadcon.com/events/wolf-chase-2014/ "Wolf Chase 2014")6 is open to all who can stumble out of bed by 7AM. It's our opportunity to not only get in some exercise, but also bring a little more aid to Doctors Without Boarders, via the [Crowdrise fundraiser](https://www.crowdrise.com/wolf-run-2016/fundraiser/ericfattig)!

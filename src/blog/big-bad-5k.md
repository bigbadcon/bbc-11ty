A few people have told The Wolf the'd like to get a little exercise at Big Bad Con. What, is running from your lives so The Wolf doesn't devour you whole not enough? So what about this, a 5K run on Sunday morning 8AM? It goes around Martin Jr. Regional Shoreline, so it should be a pretty nice run. Check it: [http://www.runningmap.com/?id=453517](http://www.runningmap.com/?id=453517)

**Comment** below if you'd be down for it. If I get 5 or more people interested we'll make it happen.

Big Bad GM Contestant Randy Davenport cannot make it to Big Bad Con. Some excuses like 2000 miles to travel or a bounty on his head are keeping him in Boston. Or maybe he just couldn't handle the pressure.Â  So the Big Bad Wolf was forced to call on his secret weapon, a GM that will make the other contestants tremble...

Justin has been rocking Fate since the Dresden Files was a "coming soon" postcard. He's used it to run Firefly space opera, horror, and many other milieus. At Big Bad Con his fate will be in the hands of the judges. Can he take the three ingredients they provide and make something magical?

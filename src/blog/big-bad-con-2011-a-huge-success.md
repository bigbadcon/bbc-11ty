[![](/images/SF-003-225x300.jpg "French toast and Hot Chocolate")](/images/SF-003.jpg)Thank you everyone who made Big Bad Con such an success. There is no way it would have happened without all of you coming and making it awesome.

I'm going to break from the voice of "The Wolf" for a moment and tell you that this event was like my birthday, Christmas and New Years all at once. I being in an environment of people gaming and enjoying themselves. Throughout the con I heard laughs, shouts, and huzzahs that told me, without a doubt, people were having a great time. Being part of the event that made that happen was a privilege and an honor for me.

I learned a lot this year and have a lot to consider about how to run Big Bad Con 2012, but one thing I can say for sure, it will happen and it will ROCK!

Today The Wolf rests, and enjoys the "Fantastic French Toast" from Cafe du Soleil.

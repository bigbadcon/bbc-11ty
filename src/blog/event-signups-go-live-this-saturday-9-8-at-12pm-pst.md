[![](/images/Red-Portrait-med-300x300.jpg)](https://www.bigbadcon.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Red-Portrait-med.jpg)The moment is upon us. Big Bad Con event signups are about to start and here's everything you need to know to get into your favorite games, panels, and special events!

### When do signups start?

Saturday 9/8 at 12PM PST

### What do you need to signup?

To signup for events, you need a badge! You can verify your existing badge [here](https://www.bigbadcon.com/events/verify-your-2018-big-bad-con-badge/), or if you still need one, purchase it [here](https://www.bigbadcon.com/sign-up/).

### How does it work?

Go to any of the events listed on our [event page](https://www.bigbadcon.com/events/) and, if there is an opening, click the Book Now button at the bottom of the event page. That's it. You're in!

You can confirm the events you're signed up for by going to [My Bookings](https://www.bigbadcon.com/events/my-bookings/).

### How many events can you sign up for?

Not everyone is available the moment signups open. So we’ve instituted signup phases, approximately one week apart to give everyone a chance to get into games. At each phase you can book into more events:

Phase I (Saturday 9/8 12PM PST) — Everyone can sign up for a maximum of 2 events. Phase II (Monday 9/17 7PM PST) — Everyone can sign up for a maximum of 4 events. Phase III (Sunday 9/23 7PM PST) — Event signups have no maximum limit.

### A few things to note:

Games held in the [Teen Room](https://www.bigbadcon.com/events/categories/teens/) are open only to teens for the first two weeks of registration. After which, they are open to everyone. Events marked [All Ages](https://www.bigbadcon.com/events/categories/all-ages/) are available to all attendees, including teens, but they do not get priority. Events you’re running don’t count against your limit. Some specific events (Wolf Chase, panels, workshops, large larps) don’t count against your limit either.

For more information on signing up for games and full list of quota exempt games, head over [here](https://www.bigbadcon.com/how-are-game-sign-ups-going-to-work/).

We're so excited about Big Bad Con this year and we're looking forward to seeing you there. If you have any questions or concerns, please let us know!

The Wolf has rounded up all the bottles and cans of food as well as cold hard cash to make donations across the board. For the Alameda County Community Food bay we raised 230lbs of food, enough for 176 meals. For Doctors Without Borders we raised $505, the donation placed today!

Fancy certificates of appreciation form Doctors Without Borders coming soon!

[![improv_for_gamers_level_1](/images/improv_for_gamers_level_1-300x109.jpg)](http://www.bigbadcon.com/events/improv-for-gamers/)Improv for Gamers, led by Karen Twevles and Mia Blankensop just had an awesome workshop on the 7/13. Because of this, they are even more exited than before about offering the workshop again at Big Bad Con!

**Here's some of the feedback from the 7/13 event:** "Thanks to you and everyone making Improv for Gamers Workshop happen! It was a great time." - _Colin F._

"Such a blast & I learned stuff too.  I'm now a 2nd level Improve Gm. Beware, y'all." - _Matt S._

"Thanks! I really enjoyed the Level 2 workshop saturday! When is Level 3? I think it would be cool if after the Fiasco portion, the group could reconvene and recap on some of our cool experiences and highlights from play – while they were still fresh in our minds. I think that could really exemplify some of the wonderful techniques we learned!" _\- Dale H._

"It was awesome. Looking forward to applying beats and editing (finding the best scene end) to my games ASAP!" _\- Tim S._

Excited? We're excited! Check out more about [Improv for Gamers](http://www.bigbadcon.com/events/improv-for-gamers/) workshop!

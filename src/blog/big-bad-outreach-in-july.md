On July 13th, the Big Bad Outreach GMs Beth Daggert, Ezra Denny, Colin Fahrion, Karen Twelves, and Jeeyon Shim headed out to [University Village at Albany](https://universityvillage.berkeley.edu/) to run games for the teens there! We played One Night Werewolf, Paranoia, 11pm Metal Showcase, and Star Force.

That for hosing us UVA, and thanks for playing great game with us UVA teens! We're looking forward to seeing you in October!

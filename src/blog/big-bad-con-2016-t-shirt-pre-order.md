![Big Bad Con 2016 T-Shirt](/images/Big-Bad-Con-2016-T-Shirt-277x300.jpg)Thanks to the wonderful folk at [Heart of the Deernicorn](http://heartofthedeernicorn.com/), we have t-shirts for 2016! [Ross Cowman](https://twitter.com/RossCowman) proposed many custom designs, and the final one was [selected online by you](https://twitter.com/bigbadcon/status/783393808914362369)!

The shirts are $20 each and printed on American Apparel tees (sizes SM-XL) and Jerzees tees (sizes 2XL-4XL) using a non-toxic water based ink, which will fade gradually rather than crack or split over time.

We're printing a limited quantity of shirts to sell at the registration desk. Pre-order now and pick up your shirt when you check in!

**Update 10/13:** Pre-orders now closed but there are still plenty of shirts left. Pick yours up at the con!

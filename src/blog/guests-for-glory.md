Take heart! If you come to Big Bad Con this year, you won’t face the [duck knights](http://www.bigbadcon.com/events/the-duck-knight-rises/) and [psychic schoolgirls](http://www.bigbadcon.com/events/psychic-schoolgirl-showdown-3/) and [perils of a haunted desert](http://www.bigbadcon.com/events/forbidden-desert/) alone. Thanks to the community who really came through on our Kickstarter, we’ve provided a pantheon of special guests—game designers, event-runners, and masterminds alike—to make our journey to the heights and depths of danger (and/or [New Jersey](http://www.bigbadcon.com/events/welcome-to-new-jersey/)) the best it can be.

### Elsa will be hosting:

- [Blind Lady vs RPG & Larp](http://www.bigbadcon.com/events/blind-lady-vs-rpg-larp/), a panel aimed at giving game designers and game runners the tools to make their games inclusive for players with disabilities.
- [Destroying The Fake Geek Girl Fallacy](http://www.bigbadcon.com/events/destroying-the-fake-geek-girl-fallacy/), a panel tearing apart the fallacy of the Fake Geek Girl, why this trope is harmful to women and to the gaming community at large.
- [Dead Scare](http://www.bigbadcon.com/events/dead-scare/), a game of blood-stained picket fences, makeshift weapons, and survival. You play as the women and children of 1950s American Suburbia. It’s 1953. The radios went off days ago, and here you are at home, on summer break, bored out of your mind. When the zeds come.

**Update 9/30/2016:** Due to health reasons Elsa will not be able to attend Big Bad Con this year. We hope to see her back in 2017! Elsa has given the funds allocated to her from the Kickstarter to the Scholarship Fund.

Game signups open Saturday (Sept 16) at noon PST. Here’s everything you need to know about it:

### Verify Your Badge Now

Super important. If you haven’t already, head over to [Verify your 2017 Badge](/events/verify-your-2017-big-bad-con-badge/) and click the Book Now button. If you have any trouble email [events@bigbadcon.com](mailto:events@bigbadcon.com) to let us know ASAP.

**Need to get a badge?**

No problem, head over here to [sign up](/sign-up/)!

### Signing up for Events

To get in a game or other event, go to the event page itself and if you’re eligible to get in, click the Book Now button.

**Beware the dreaded Overbooking**: Year after year we work on improving our sign ups through server upgrades and code revisions, but overbooking still happens. As our servers get bogged down, sometimes two (or more) people click the book now button while there is still one spot open and before any of the bookings have gone through. The result is that _everyone_ thinks they got into the game. We, the forest gnomes, vigilantly watch for these overbookings and as soon as we catch them we'll let the folks know with a polite, but sad "sorry, this game was overbooked" email. We'll leave the person with the earliest timestamp in the slot and ask others to pick another game. If this happens to you, we apologize in advance.

### Eligibility

- Teens (13-17) can sign up for events marked [Teens](https://www.bigbadcon.com/events/categories/teens/) and [All Ages](https://www.bigbadcon.com/events/categories/all-ages/)
- Adult attendees (18+) can sign up for all events except those marked [Teens](https://www.bigbadcon.com/events/categories/teens/). Adults will be able to sign up for all events on Sept 30 at noon PST.

### Event Phases

Signups are in three phases:

- Phase I (Sept 16 at noon PST) — everyone can sign up for a maximum of 2 events.
- Phase II (Sept 23 at noon PST) — everyone can sign up for a maximum of 4 events.
- Phase III (Sept 30 at noon PST) — event signups have no maximum limit.

### Exempt Events

Some events will be exempt from your maximum number, which means you can sign up for them without it counting against your limit during Phases I or II.

Exempt events include:

- Any event that you are running
- Panels and workshops
- Larps for 10 or more players
- Special events

While The Wolf may like the raucous hub-bub of gaming in the open, Little Red prefers a bit more seclusion in her RPG venue. This year, by popular demand, Big Bad Con has added nine private rooms for RPGs, ni additon to the existing four boardrooms we had last year. This means if you have your pyschological horror game that needs low lighting and eerie music, it's yours! If you make a lot of noise and want a private space so you don't distrub the neighbors, it's yours! If you need a room to hide the bodies of your players... well, talk to The Wolf on that one. He's dealt with the woodsman before.

Space is limited. If you would like a private room, please head over to [Run a Game](http://www.bigbadcon.com/volunteer/run-a-game/ "Run a Game") and check the "request private room" box if you need one. Submit your game soon while space lasts!

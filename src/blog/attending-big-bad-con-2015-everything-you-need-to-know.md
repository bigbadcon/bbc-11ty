### **Where to go?**

Hotel check-in is in Building 1. The convention is in Building 5 and Building 3. You can find a map of the building on the [hotel page](http://www.bigbadcon.com/?page_id=192 "Hotel").

### **Parking**

Parking is complimentary for all attendees. If you are staying at the hotel, your room key will get you in and out of the lot. If you're commuting to the con, we have passes at the registration desk, just ask for one when you get your badge

### **Internet Access**

Wireless access is available for $12.95/day. Both AT&T and Verizon have good service in the con buildings as well.

### **Registration**

If you signed up before 10/13 (either paid admission or volunteered) your badge will be ready for you at the door. If not weekend passes are $50 and one day passes are $25. You can purchase these at the con registration desk.

## Games

**Sign-ups:**  To get into any games at the con put your name down on the game sheet at the registration desk. Like we did it on the website, all open games will be first come, first served. The current day’s games will be posted on the wall, and updated for the next day at 8PM.

**Games on Demand**: Stop by the Empire Room and to jump into a game. More information about games offered and times games start [here](http://www.bigbadcon.com/games-on-demand-2015/).

**Open Gaming:** All the game slots full and nothing to? Head over to Open Gaming in the Empire Room, where we'll have awesome games running all weekend!

### Community Standards

**Policy**: Everyone at the con (attendees, volunteers, vendors, staff, and GMs) must adhere to the [Community Standards](http://www.bigbadcon.com/community-standards/).

**Content Policy:** The con is 18 and over; we expect games to cover the gamut of gonzo silly to very mature themes. More detail is on our [content policy](http://www.bigbadcon.com/?p=294 "Big Bad Con Content Standards") page.

### Accessibility

If you have an accessibility concern or question let us know. Email us at [accessibility@bigbadcon.com](mailto:accessibility@bigbadcon.com). We’ll also include this in the program, so if you notice anything while you’re there, you can let us know!

If you’re running a game and accessibility needs come up, contact any of our staff and they will get in touch with Elsa Henry (our accessibility consultant) immediately to work towards a solution.

### Surviving at the Con

**Sleep, eat and shower.** In the excitement of gaming it is easy to forget some of the basics. The 3-2-1 con rule is a good one. Every day you need at least 3 hours of sleep, 2 meals, and 1 shower.

**Up for little exercise?** The [Wolf Chase 2015](http://www.bigbadcon.com/events/wolf-chase-2015/) is open to all who can stumble out of bed by 7AM. It's our opportunity to not only get in some exercise, but also bring a little more aid to Doctors Without Boarders, via the [Crowdrise fundraiser](https://www.crowdrise.com/wolfchase2015)!

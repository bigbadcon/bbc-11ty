This October, the Wolf has invited everyone to [Grandmother’s house](http://www.hilton.com/en/hi/groups/personalized/O/OAKHIHH-BBC-20111007/index.jhtml?WT.mc_id=POG) to play, but four will compete to prove which game master is the Biggest, Baddest GM in the land! Our four hand-picked GM’s will compete in the GMing event of the year.

Using only the FATE system and three mystery game ingredients consisting of a genre, an adversary and a location, they will attempt to impress our panel of four judges with their system mastery and ability to run an excellent game with minimum prep. The winner will not only receive the title of Big Bad GM, but will also be rewarded with glory, honor, and…a pin!

Our four Big Bad GM contestants were picked due to their reputations as excellent GMs, ability to run exceptional games off the cuff and, might I say, their huge egos? Meet our four contestants and decide who you think has what it takes to claim the title:

**Mike Bogan** **The Ultimate Superfly TNT Dolemite GM Ninja of All Time**, a founder of [Good Omens](http://www.goodomensgames.com/) and 4-Eyed Demon, Mike is the go to GM for high action, over the top stunts, cinematic games. A huge fan of Feng Shui, Wushu and now FATE Mike runs games that are fast paced and intense. Mike’s enthusiasm for gaming shines through both as a GM and a player.

As the winner of the GM Throwdown at [EndGame](http://www.endgameoakland.com/) in Oakland, Mike has already claimed one trophy and he's coming to Big Bad to take another!

Mike has recently made his foray into fate, converting his games inspired by Bill Willingham's Fables from Wushu to FATE. Lets see what he can do with three secret ingredients. Who knows, one of them may be The Wolf himself!

Justin has been rocking Fate since the Dresden Files was a "coming soon" postcard. He's used it to run Firefly space opera, horror, and many other milieus. At Big Bad Con his fate will be in the hands of the judges. Can he take the three ingredients they provide and make something magical?

[![](/images/morgan.jpg)](../wp-content/uploads/2011/02/morgan.jpg) **Morgan Ellis**, the man of Mystery. Who hides behind that luchador mask? What awesome powers of GMing does he posses? One thing he is known for is not running one or two, not three or four, not even five, but SIX Dresden Files RPG games at [Origins](http://www.dresdenfilesrpg.com/2010/03/03/evil-hat-gaming-at-origins/) in 2010. Will his fortitude be enough to stand up the ultimate challenge? We'll find out at Big Bad Con!

Big Bad Con is the first to host a Race to Adventure Tournament!

Are you a _Spirit of the Century_ fan or just a pulp adventure enthusiast? Would you like to get a sneak peek at Evil Hat's first board game months before it hits the stores? Do you have 20 mins to spare to stop Doctor Methuselah, Shadow Mathemagician, from overpowering the poor people of the UK? Then join the co-designer of the game for the Friday teach and casual play of Race to Adventure! - _The Spirit of the Century_ Exploration Game. Itâ€™s the best way to prep for the Saturday and Sunday tournaments, where you can win the out-of-print Spirit of the Season, featuring characters and rules compatible with both _Spirit of the Century_ and _Truth & Justice_!

Since _Race to Adventure!_ hasn't gone to print yet, you'll be playing the early prototype. So yes, there WILL be cool art on the cards ... eventually! Come race around the globe with us!

Three events will be run by co-creator Eric Lytle:

You’re coming to Big Bad Con! Awesome. Before you get on the road, here's a few things to know about the con:

### Support FBCCS! Bring non-perishable food

Big Bad Con collects food for the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano County as part of our community outreach. The FBCCS provides food to over 190,000 people per month. You can support them by bringing out non-perishable food (especially items on this [shopping list](https://www.bigbadcon.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Food-Drive-Shopping-List.pdf)) to the con.

### Get into more games

During the con if you want to add an [event](https://www.bigbadcon.com/events/) or need to cancel out of one (please only do so if you really can't make it), you can do so from either your mobile device or one of the kiosk computers we have set up at the registration desk. You can also stay connected with our [Discord](https://discord.gg/JmpDb2j) server!

You can also stop by the Contra Costa room to play in Games on Demand. There’s a variety of systems to choose from! You can see the full list of games on offer and GMs running them [online](https://www.bigbadcon.com/games-on-demand-2018/). Start times are listed [here](https://www.bigbadcon.com/games-on-demand/), but remember to show up about 10 minutes early to get into a game.

### How to get to the con

Big Bad Con is hosted in the Walnut Creek Marriott. Depending on where you’re coming from, there are several ways to get to us.

Driving: the hotel is right off Interstate 680. Get [driving directions here](https://goo.gl/maps/KNj3fCYs5eK2). Note that parking is normally $23/day, but the convention rate is $10/day. Not all of the valets may be aware of the rate reduction but the hotel staff will make sure you’re billed the discounted rate.

Flying: Depending on your flight, you might be landing in either Oakland International Airport (OAK) or San Francisco International Airport (SFO). Both airports have BART (subway) stations attached to them, so you can hop on a train and go to the hotel!

Public Transportation: If at all possible we recommend taking BART to get to the hotel. The Walnut Creek Station is a 12-minute walk away, or you can call the hotel shuttle service (925-934-2000) for a pickup.

For more information about getting to the hotel and to book a room, check out the [Hotel](https://www.bigbadcon.com/hotel/) page.

### Need assistance? Here's how to get in touch

There will be volunteers (wearing yellow handkerchiefs) in all the major event areas and at the registration desk. If you need assistance or run into any trouble, they are there to help!

If you want to contact the staff, feel free to email us at [support@bigbadcon.com](mailto:support@bigbadcon.com) or call (510) 646-0073. We're around all con long!

### Community standards

Everyone at the con (attendees, volunteers, vendors, staff, and GMs) must adhere to the [Community Standards](https://www.bigbadcon.com/community-standards/) policy.

The con is open to all attendees 13 and older. Guests 13-17 will need waiver signed by a parent or guardian when they pick up their badge. More information [here](https://www.bigbadcon.com/age-policy/).

### Staying healthy and happy during the con

In the excitement of gaming it is easy to forget some of the basics. The **3-2-1 rule** is a good one. Every day you need at least 3 hours of sleep, 2 meals, and 1 shower. We also have a quiet room (room 599) available if you need a little quiet time as well!

Up for some exercise? The Wolf Run is open to all who can stumble out of bed by 7AM. It’s our opportunity to not only get in some exercise, but also bring a little more aid to Doctors Without Borders, via the Crowdrise fundraiser!

So excited! See you at the con!

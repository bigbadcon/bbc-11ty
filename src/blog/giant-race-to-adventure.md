[![](/images/rTA-300x114.jpg "rTA")](/images/rTA.jpg)Remember last year when we [demo'd the prototype for Race to Adventure](http://www.bigbadcon.com/race-to-adventure/)? Well, RTA is back, and BIGGER than ever!

Eric K Lytle, one of the game designers will be back at Big Bad Con running not just the soon to b e released Race To Adventure, but a GIANT version of the soon to be released Race to Adventure. About the game:

_Race to Adventure!™ is easy to learn, and you can play in 20-30 minutes. In each round, players will take turns selecting one of 6 different items … and then all players perform their action at the same time. Snatch a golden eagle egg from a Himalayan mountain peak, escape the Mummy King, rescue a prisoner from Atlantis and much more in this family adventure game!_

Eric will be running games between the normal RPG time slots Saturday and Sunday evening at 7PM. Sign up for them now:

Saturday - [GIANT Race to Adventure](http://www.bigbadcon.com/events/giant-race-to-adventure/ "GIANT Race to Adventure!") Sunday - [GIANT Race to Adventure](http://www.bigbadcon.com/events/giant-race-to-adventure-2/ "GIANT Race to Adventure!")

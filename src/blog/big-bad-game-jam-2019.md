![](/images/YUfyUR.jpg)Let's make games inspired by and about **FOLK TALES & FABLES**! We can play them at [Big Bad Con](https://www.bigbadcon.com/), a tabletop and live action gaming convention featuring fantastic games and even better company- happening in Oakland, CA October 10th - 13th, 2019!

Join the game jam on [itch.io](https://itch.io/jam/big-bad-game-jam)

#### Important Details:

Submissions Open: **April 13th, 2019** Submissions Due: **May 31st, 2019**

#### Rules:

- Be inspired by fables, folk tales and fairy tales
- Follow [BBC community standards](https://www.bigbadcon.com/community-standards/) (no hate, discrimination or harassment will be tolerated, though games addressing or exploring these in a serious and respectful way are allowed)
- Make any kind of game you like- ttrpg, larp, video game, journaling, etc.

### Anthology

After the jam closes, games creators who have opted to include will be collected into an Anthology and sold, with proceeds going towards our [scholarship](https://www.bigbadcon.com/big-bad-con-scholarship-fund/) and sponsorship funds—which will help us bring folks to the convention! Including your game in the Anthology is optional and you can still offer your game for sale on Itch.io and other platforms.

If you want to add your game to the Anthology, once you submit it on [Itch](https://itch.io/jam/big-bad-game-jam), can you also email a pdf to itch@bigbadcon.com? This way I'll be able to assemble the Anthology once the jam is over.

### Resources

In light of the recent revelations about Zak S by Mandy Morbid, Big Bad Con staff wish to publicly reinforce our commitment as a convention and community to creating safer, more inclusive space.

We regularly revisit our [community standards](https://www.bigbadcon.com/community-standards/) to ensure our community is a place where all can come and enjoy themselves, and we have clear public statements of those standards. Abuse and harassment are never welcome at Big Bad Con.

We support Mandy. We believe her and the others who have made statements of their experiences. We have decided to formally state that Zak S is not allowed to attend our convention in any capacity, nor are any of his games to be part of our formal schedule. While we take no issue with people deciding to play his games as a personal choice, we feel it is vital to our community commitment not to promote a known abuser, and we will not give his games a platform at our convention.

_This statement made in solidarity with [Mandy's original statement](https://www.facebook.com/amandapatricianagy/posts/10215845527064252blog) (CN: abuse, DV, SA)_

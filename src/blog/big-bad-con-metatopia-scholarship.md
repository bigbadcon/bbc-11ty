[![](/images/jackson-tegu-300x278.png)](/images/jackson-tegu.png)Inspired by [IGDN](https://www.igdnonline.com/metatopia-diversity-sponsorship) and in cooperation with [Double Exposure](https://dexposure.com/home.html), Big Bad Con is sending game designer Jackson Tegu to Metatopia to playtest his game Silver and White.

Metatopia is held each November in Morristown, NJ. It's a place where designers can find educational panels, get professional feedback on their game, and develop a larger sense of community. The scholarship covers travel, lodging, and a conference badge so that designers can show off their games and make connections with industry professionals.

In the past Big Bad Con has supported the IGDN Sponsorship enabling Jeeyon Shim (2017) and Roe Nix (2016) to attend. We're excited to see more amazing designers have a chance to playtest their games at Metatpoia!

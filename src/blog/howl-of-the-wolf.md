As Kublacon approaches, The Wolf wants to deputize fellow gamers to spread the “Howl of The Wolf”.   In exchange, you get to be part of the con (listed in the credits as an advertiser), get a shiny “Howl of The Wolf” pin, and if you’re a Facebook user, get a matching “Howl of The Wolf” badge for profile.

**What The Wolf wants from you:**

The Wolf has a big pile of shiny Big Bad Con Fliers and Business cards to hand out at KublaCon. You get a stack of 10 of each (or more if you want them). Give them out at your games or to people you talk to at Kubla.  Tell them about Big Bad Con and direct them to the website or [thewolf@bigbadcon.com](mailto:thewolf@bigbadcon.com) if they have any questions. Go ahead and tell them about how you got the pin as well if they ask, The Wolf is happy to add members to the wolf pack at the con.

**What The Wolf will provide:**

When The Wolf sees you at KublaCon, he’ll had over the fliers, business cards and a limited edition Big Bad Con achievement, the “Howl of The Wolf” pin, which is only available to gamers who help advertise for the con in advance.  If you’re a Facebook user, The Wolf will also link you to a the “Howl of The Wolf” badge you can add to your profile.

**How to do it:**

Simple, let The Wolf know you’re interested either by replying sending an [email](mailto:thewolf@bigbadcon.com) or RSVP to the “[Howl of The Wolf](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=114375851980310)” event on Facebook and he’ll arrange getting you the promotional material as well as get you name as you want it to appear on the credits for the con.

If you’re not attending Kublacon but still want to spread the word (amongst your local gamers, at a store, etc) The Wolf is happy with that too, just let him know that when you email or RSVP and he’ll make arrangements to get you the goods.

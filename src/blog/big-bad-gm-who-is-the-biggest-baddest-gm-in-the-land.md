This October, the Wolf has invited everyone to Grandmother’s house to play, but four will compete to prove which game master is the Biggest, Baddest GM in the land! Our four GMs were selected by popular demand by the players at Big Bad Con 2011.

Using only the FATE system and three mystery game ingredients consisting of a genre, an adversary and a location, they will attempt to impress our panel of four judges with their system mastery and ability to run an excellent game with minimum prep. The winner will not only receive the title of Big Bad GM, but will also be rewarded with glory, honor, and…a pin!

Our four Big Bad GM contestants were picked due by the players last year for their exceptional games, and might I say, their huge egos? Meet our four contestants and decide who you think has what it takes to claim the title:

**Mike Bogan** **The Ultimate Superfly TNT Dolemite GM Ninja of All Time**, a founder of [Good Omens](http://www.goodomensgames.com/) and 4-Eyed Demon, Mike is the go to GM for high action, over the top stunts, cinematic games. A huge fan of Feng Shui, Wushu and now FATE Mike runs games that are fast paced and intense. Mike’s enthusiasm for gaming shines through both as a GM and a player.

As the winner of the GM Throwdown at [EndGame](http://www.endgameoakland.com/) in Oakland, Mike has already claimed one trophy and he's coming to Big Bad to take another!

Mike was a contender in Big Bad GM last year and the crowd loved him so much they brought him back again. Maybe this time he can take the title!

[![](/images/Staythirstymyfriends-298x300.jpg "Michael Garcia")](http://www.bigbadcon.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Staythirstymyfriends.jpg)**Michael Garcia** - It's an honor to compete with the GMs that I have come to idolize. I've played their games: they are awesome. I have no illusions here. I am the rookie, the scrappy underdog who hungers for glory but fears the bitter taste of defeat. However, I have accepted the challenge and now my job is to bring it. In preparation of Big Bad GM I am training, hard. I am reading the rules, sharpening my skills, and running every game prior to Big Bad GM as if it was my last. I'm coming to this competition ready for a dragged out, knockdown brawl. When the smoke clears and the victor is announced I will wear my bruises with pride, knowing I stood against the best.

"Michael Garcia . . . a man who has walked into insanity and stepped back out into sanity to tell the tale. This GM will mesmerize you with his cruel and creepy characters but whatever you do, you gotta hear him do the German accent. Really! If you're blinded in his game, it isn't the sunlight. It's Mike G. grabbing lightning out of the sky like Zeus and throwing it in your face. You've played in his Jack the Ripper game, right? If not you're missing out, playas."

I'm pretty new to this con gaming thing, starting about two years ago at Kubla Con, where a fortune teller told me I'd have a lot of fun, then spilled my coffee. Well, I didn't even get in a scheduled game that day but ended up in a pick-up game with an awesome Gm who saved me from going home disappointed and somehow ended up at Endgame a couple months later running Apocalypse World and loving the heck out of it.

Play to find out what happens, words to live by and this competition is the ultimate example. As a GM I strive to challenge the players with a situation which even I don't know how the players will manage to untangle. Those times when absolutely unexpected and awesome things happen are what I game for." - Scott

He's too modest. Scott is going to cool down from this competition by running one of his awesome Apocalypse World games, [Ghost Market](http://www.bigbadcon.com/events/ghost-market/ "Ghost Market").

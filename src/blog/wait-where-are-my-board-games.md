We like board games. We like to play them. We would like you to play them too. But we don’t have a board game track. Why is that?

To put it simply, Big Bad Con is still growing, and we’re starting off by chasing the prey we know the best—Little Red. Actually, that’s not right. We’ve started off with a focus on the type of games we know best—RPGs. We do offer a few board games, which we’ll make sure to announce on twitter as well as in person, and we welcome board games in our open gaming space. But right now, we don’t have the personnel or space to make a full board game track happen.

But it will. If we’re lying, we’ll walk around the con in grandma’s nightgown.

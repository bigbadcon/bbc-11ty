Little Red has given her stamp of approval on the T-shirt art, and we are now ready to take orders. We're only going to have a limited number for sale at the con, so pre-order before Sept 14th and when you arrive at Big Bad Con, your order will be waiting for you!

These shirts are a major upgrade from last year. High quality [American Apparel](http://www.americanapparel.net/) tees!

Don't like PayPal? Don't have the green in your account now but will at the con? Just prefer to pay in cash? That's okay too. Just click here to [Contact The Wolf](http://www.bigbadcon.com/contact/ "Contact"), give him your order, and it will be waiting for you at the con. Note: Please make sure to include all relevant information (size, color and cut for t-shirts - size for hoodies).

Big Bad Con denounces genocide, apartheid, and human rights violations. We believe in every person's right to self-determination, autonomy, and liberty.

We believe in the decolonization of Palestine, which we define as full equal rights for all people who dwell on the land. We do not condone calls for violence or expulsion of anyone in the region.

We call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and an embargo on US military support for Israel. We call for an end of Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, and the invasion of Lebanon.

### What does this mean for Big Bad Con?

Big Bad Con is a gaming convention dedicated to our [community standards](https://www.bigbadcon.com/community-standards/) of Respect, Support, and Kindness. While we cannot significantly affect the events on the world stage, we can however ensure that our own community is a safer and welcoming space. 

When we use the terms “Zionism” and “anti-Zionism”, we base them on the definition provided by the [Jewish Voice for Peace](https://www.jewishvoiceforpeace.org/resource/zionism/): “While it had many strains historically, the Zionism that took hold and stands today is a settler-colonial movement, establishing an apartheid state \[in Israel] where Jews have more rights than others.” Using this definition, we align ourselves in opposition to the oppressive actions of this form of Zionism, and stand in allyship with those oppressed by it. This is what we mean when we say that we are an anti-Zionist space.

The claim that anti-Zionism is antisemitism is a means to deflect criticism of Israel’s governmental actions. We reject the claim that anti-Zionism is antisemitic, and reject the use of this claim as a silencing tactic against Palestinians and those who stand in solidarity with them.

We cherish the Jewish members of our community. We will not tolerate anti-Zionism being used as an excuse for harassment. 

Our [anti-harassment policy](https://www.bigbadcon.com/anti-harassment-policy/) forbids hate speech and we expect everyone, especially when discussing difficult topics, to embody our [community standards](https://www.bigbadcon.com/community-standards/) and treat each other with Respect, Support, and Kindness. Inclusion in our spaces is based on behavior, not by beliefs or identities.

The use of phrases and slogans to stand for complex sets of values is an important part of establishing a welcoming and supportive environment for those working to liberate themselves and others from oppression. 

We acknowledge that phrases and slogans are used to stand for complex sets of values. Phrases such as “Black Lives Matter”, “never again”, “anti-racist”, “anti-Zionist”, and “from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” are calls for the end of oppression and the liberation of oppressed peoples. 

Context matters, and we presume the good faith of activists using these phrases. However, the use of these or any other phrase as a call for violence will not be tolerated in the Convention space.

We recognize that Palestinians, Arabs, and Muslims are often subject to Islamophobic discrimination, dehumanization, and violence. We recognize that Jews are often subject to antisemitic discrimination, dehumanization, and violence. We abhor Islamophobia and antisemitism, and will not tolerate them in our spaces.

Big Bad Con was called on by our community to demonstrate our position as a convention dedicated to supporting marginalized communities. We know that our allyship on these issues has been insufficient and we acknowledge the impact this has had on our community as we worked on this document.

### What are we doing to help?

In addition to our above public statement, we are also responding with direct action. We call on our community in turn to join us in providing immediate support to the following relief efforts.

We have donated a total of $5,000 to the following relief funds. From now until October 27, 2024, we will match donations (up to another $5,000 total) to these causes:

* [Crips for eSims for Gaza](https://chuffed.org/project/crips-for-esims-for-gaza), a digital lifeline for people in Gaza cut off from the internet.

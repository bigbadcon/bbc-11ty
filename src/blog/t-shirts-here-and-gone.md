Big Bad Con T-shirts came in today and fast as three pigs can run from a blown down house The Wolf shipped them off. If you ordered a shirt and aren't doing will call (read: The Wolf handing it over in person) you should receive your Big Bad Swag soon!

Note: There is one order we didn't get a name for. If you live on Irving Street in San Francisco and ordered a Men's Medium Burgundy shirt, email thewolf@bigbaccon.con, tell him who you are and he'll ship it off!

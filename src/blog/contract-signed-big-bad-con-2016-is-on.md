The contract is signed, scanned, and emailed to the Walnut Creek Marriott, who at this very moment is hosting [FOGcon](http://fogcon.org/)! Some of the awesome amenities at the hotel:

- Three blocks from BART, and a shuttle service to pick up and drop you off!
- Absolutely beautiful spaces to game and socialize in. A great lobby, several comfy nooks, and secret passages between rooms!
- 4000 more square feet that we had at the Hilton!
- Free Wi-fi for all attendees
- Discounted valet parking for all attendees
- All-gender bathrooms
- 20 private gaming rooms
- Over 100 restaurants in a 3 miles radius. Over a dozen in a 3 block radius. The hotel shuttle will take you to _any_ of them!

What's more is that three weeks after Big Bad Con 2016, we'll sign a contract for 2017 so we'll have the dates and rates locked in! More pictures and details [here](http://www.bigbadcon.com/a-new-home-in-walnut-creek/).

So excited for Big Bad Con's new home. Stay tuned for some big announcements in our upcoming Kickstarter campaign!

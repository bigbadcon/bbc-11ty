Little Red is looking for GMs to run these brand new games at Big Bad Con. What's more, if you do sign up to run one of them, she'll endeavor to get you a PDF copy of the game so you actually have the rules before you run it! To run any of them click here to [Run a Game](http://www.bigbadcon.com/volunteer/run-a-game/ "Run a Game").

**Vicious Crucible** games are short RPGs set in detailed corners of a fantasy world.

**Durance** is Jason Morningstarâ€™s take on life in a far-future penal colony. It's a fast-paced, low-prep, collaborative tabletop game.

**Project Ninja Panda Taco** is a game where you get to play a Mastermind and Minion trying to take over the world.

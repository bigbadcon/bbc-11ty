[![](/images/baybridgelightning-300x168.jpg "baybridgelightning")](/images/baybridgelightning.jpg)The Wolf hasn't got anything out for the Bay Area. It's a nice place to huff and puff, you know.

But these GMs...i'm just saying.

[Oakland Haze](http://www.bigbadcon.com/events/oakland-haze/ "Oakland Haze")Â - Gamma World game set in the remains of Oakland.

[Does History Repeat Itself](http://www.bigbadcon.com/events/does-history-repeat-itself/ "Does History Repeat Itself?") - Dresden Files set in San Francisco - A city of dreams and nightmares.

[Monsters Menace Modest0](http://www.bigbadcon.com/events/monsters-menace-modesto/ "Monsters Menace Modesto") - Last Stand game... I think that says it all! Okay... not quite the bay, but close!

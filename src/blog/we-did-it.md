### Huzzah!

[This is amazing](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1157274964/big-bad-con-2016/). You've gone above and beyond all that we hoped for!

Thank you once again for your contributions, for spreading the word about the con and the Kickstarter, and for being so awesome!

### Celebrate!

We’re going to have a Google Hangout to celebrate, talk about about the con this year, and generally geek out today at 1PM PST. If you’re free, please join us: [https://plus.google.com/u/0/events/cg582bp83hajr61bcvkircib8q4](https://plus.google.com/u/0/events/cg582bp83hajr61bcvkircib8q4)

**Finally, a send off from Kool & The Gang. Couldn’t resist!**

Our Fall 2022 Online event is almost here! So, let's take a moment to give you a quick rundown of how Go Play NW Online events work.

## Where will Go Play NW Online take place?
We’ll be running games on our community [Discord](https://discord.gg/AqhayGFexQ) server. If you don't already have a free Discord account, you'll need to create one, and you'll want to do that before register and buy your ticket so that we can get your Discord username on our guest list.

## How much does a ticket to Go Play NW Online 2022 cost?
Tickets for Go Play NW Onine 2022 are Pay-What-You-Will.

We have a suggested donation $12 per day for the event, but ultimately you should decide what you can afford based on your personal financial situation (we offer a free option for a reason!).

## How do I get into a game I want to play or run?
At Go Play NW, all of our games are run by our attendees (folks like you!)

You can either sign-up for a game in advance, which we call "**Scheduled games**," or you join/run a game on the day of the event by joining our pitch circle, which we call "**the Donut.**"

### How do I schedule a game I want to run for the weekend?
Once you're registered, you can submit a game you'd like to run from our [Run a Game](/run-an-event) page.

Once your game is submitted, it will be reviewed by our event organizers before being approved and posted to our [Game Schedule](/events). In most cases the review is pretty quick, and we'll contact you if there are any clarifications we need to make regarding your game submission.

### How do I sign up to join the Donut?
No sign-up is necessary for participating in the donut, but if you want to help us keep the event running as smoothly as possible and to help you manage your schedule, you can sign-up for the Donut in advance on our [Game Schedule](/events).

If you don't get around to signing-up, don't worry! Anyone can hop into the Donut! Once you're checked in for the event, you will see a section dedicated to the Donut on our Discord server. Simply join the Donut Stage channel at the start of the Game Session and we'll get you into a game.

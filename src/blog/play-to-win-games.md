![logo-envoy](/images/logo-envoy-300x112.png)Thanks to the wonderful folks from [Envoy](http://www.dexposure.com/envoy/) and the generous contributions for game manufacturers, this year Big Bad Con will return with the Play-To-Win program! And it will be Bigger and Badder than before!

### Rules

1. Check out a copy of a Play-to-Win Game, when available, from the Game Library in Open Gaming.
2. Find a space and play the game.
3. Return the game to the Game Library with a list of the first and last names of those who participated/played in the Play-to-Win game. Game Library staff will track participant/player entries. Note: Only one entry per person per Play-to-Win game during the convention.

### Winning

The Play-to-Win game drawings will take place and winners' names will be posted at the registration desk on Sunday at 1:00 PM. Players must be present at the convention to win. Unclaimed games will be donated to the Big Bad Con Game Library.

### Available Games

It's too soon to say for sure which games will be available, but we'll update the list as the event draws near!

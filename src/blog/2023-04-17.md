The moment you’ve all been waiting for has finally arrived (approximately 10 hours ago, but I’m finally on lunch…) our July event registration is now open! You can register [here](/register/). 

Go Play NW is great because our attendees make it great. You can help make Go Play NW 2023 a success! After you register, take a minute to peruse the events on the [game schedule](/events/) and sign up to [run your own favorite game](/run-an-event), or [join our volunteer ranks](/volunteer). Volunteers working two or more shifts receive a comped ticket as a thanks for their hard work! 

Want to give back in a different way? For our paid event, we’re bringing back our scholarship program. To sponsor another person’s ticket, simply add a scholarship ticket to your cart during your ticket purchase. You can also donate to Go Play NW the same way using the donation option. Because Go Play NW is a player-focused convention, we have no industry sponsorships, so ticket revenues and donations are our only revenue. 

Need to use a scholarship? Sponsored tickets are available to anyone in our community for whom purchasing a ticket would be too great a financial burden. To apply for a scholarship ticket or to find out more about this program, you can visit https://goplaynw.org/scholarship/.

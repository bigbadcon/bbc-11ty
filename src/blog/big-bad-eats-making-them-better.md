Big Bad Con is growing every year, and the Goats welcome back attendees from previous years and can’t wait to meet people coming for the first time.

We’ve gotten amazing feedback from happy con-goers, and we’re more motivated than ever to keep expanding and improving.

And one thing that we’ve heard from you that needs improving is the availability of fast, cheap, and healthy food.

To address this, we’ve made some accomplishments and are still working on more options.

### Achievement Unlocked: More Service!

The hotel restaurant is going to have three more staff that weekend in anticipation of the rush of hungry gamers. They’ve had slow service in the past, and we’re optimistic that this will make a difference.

But the Goats, Little Red, and the Wolf want you to have more options, so they put their heads together for some other plans to improve food availability. Some were shot down by hotel management; Big Bad Con is simply not allowed to bring in outside food for its guests. Some nixed ideas were:

- Bringing in lunch platters
- Hiring Tina Tamale or other local food trucks to sling tasty treats in the parking lot
- Roasting a pig (Okay, the Wolf wanted that for himself)

### But we want more!

One idea still on the table is Grandma’s Deliveries, wherein our hard-working con volunteers do scheduled food runs to various take-outs up the road, with a list of pre-paid orders. The logistics of this have yet to be determined, so we’re not ready to declare this a viable option.

### What do YOU think?

What else can Big Bad Con do to improve your dining experience? Throw some ideas down in the comments and let’s see what we come up with.

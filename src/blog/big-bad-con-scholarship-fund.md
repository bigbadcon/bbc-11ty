Big Bad Con is committed to cultivating a spectacular and diverse gaming community. Our Scholarship Fund goes towards travel, hotel, and badge fees for attendees from marginalized groups who need assistance. In 2019 we were able to offer 20 scholarships up from 13 in 2018, 11 in 2017, up from 7 in 2016, and 4 in 2015.

To support diversity at Big Bad Con, these funds will go to help financially challenged women, people of color, disabled, and lgbtqia+ individuals attend the con. We will use it to cover hotel rooms ($135+/night), convention badges ($60), and other necessary fees. Depending on the number of applicants, we may be able cover full or partial costs.

### Timeline

Scholarship applications are currently closed. We're reviewing them now and will reach out to applicants by early September.

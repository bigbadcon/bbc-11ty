Last year (2023) with the help of Pixel Circus, Big Bad Online is hosted Virtual Office Hours where TTRPG industry professionals met with nearly 60 creators from marginalized identities to help them advance their careers. The meetings took place on April 1st (no joke here!) during Big Bad Online. It was a smashing success!-->

We’re taking COVID-safety as seriously as we can for our return to in-person. That means KN-95 level or higher masks will be required in all indoor spaces and recommended for outdoor spaces. Don’t worry: if you forget your mask, we’ll provide one for you! You can find out more about this and all the other steps we’re taking to keep our attendees safe by reading our full 2023 COVID-19 Policy.

**Weâ€™re excited to announce that we've disbursed all 100 grants (a total of $30,000) to grant recipients!**

The Story Synth microgrant program is focused on helping marginalized game designers create, publish, and monetize games on the Story Synth platform! Each microgrant is a $300 award. In addition to those funds, game developers will receive proceeds generated by their games through micropayments.

More information about the program is available [here](https://www.bigbadcon.com/story-synth-microgrants/). You can find many of the completed games here [storysynth.org/Microgrant-Gallery](https://storysynth.org/Microgrant-Gallery/ "https://storysynth.org/Gallery/")

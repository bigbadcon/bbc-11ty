At Big Bad Con 2024 we were delighted to introduce a new panel track led by [Dr. Emily Friedman](https://www.ecfriedman.com/) and [Dr. Evan Torner](https://guyintheblackhat.com/) and sponsored by [Auburn University](https://www.auburn.edu/): **Big Bad Academy**!

The academy is a chance for gaming academic to attend, speak, learn, and connect at Big Bad Con. With the support of Auburn University, we're able to bring out a diverse group of academics through our [scholarship program](https://www.bigbadcon.com/bbc-scholars/) and we'll be hosting an academic panel track including: [Intersectionality at the Table](https://www.bigbadcon.com/events/big-bad-academy), [Dice, Deviance, & Dragons](https://www.bigbadcon.com/events/big-bad-academy-dice-deviance-dragons), [Playing with Canons!](https://www.bigbadcon.com/events/big-bad-academy-playing-with-canons), and [This Has Happened Before: Historical Lessons on Community](https://www.bigbadcon.com/events/big-bad-academy-this-has-happened-before-historical-lessons-on-community).

The POC Programming team is [continuing our work to support POCs at Big Bad Con](https://www.bigbadcon.com/blog/poc-programming-at-big-bad-con-2022/) through financial aid, a community dinner, and an industry meet and greet event. This year weâ€™re also working with local gamers in India, South East Asia, and Latin America to bring more international POCs to the con!

After careful consideration, we have concluded that we are unable to host our in-person convention this year. Big Bad Online is also on hiatus. We discussed this thoroughly and this decision was not reached lightly. Our volunteer Staff and Rangers exceeded expectations in organizing last yearâ€™s convention. We thank them for their hard work.

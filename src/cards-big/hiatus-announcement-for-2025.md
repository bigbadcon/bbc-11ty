After careful consideration, we have concluded that we are unable to host our in-person convention this year. Big Bad Online is also on hiatus. The decision was discussed thoroughly and was not reached lightly.

Our volunteer Staff and Rangers exceeded expectations in organizing last yearâ€™s convention. We thank them for their hard work, and thank you all for your support.

This is all that we are able to share for now, but we will keep you informed as soon as anything further develops.

Sincerely,

the Big Bad Con team

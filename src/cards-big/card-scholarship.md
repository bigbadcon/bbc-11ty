Go Play NW is committed to cultivating and supporting a spectacular and diverse gaming community. Part of the way we do that is by collecting donations to our scholarship program, which helps cover ticket costs for women, people of color, disabled, and lgbtqia+. Depending on the number of applicants, we may be able cover your ticket cost for the weekend.

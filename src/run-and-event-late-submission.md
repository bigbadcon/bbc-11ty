General event submissions are closed. If you were sent this link, however, you've still got an opportunity to run a LARP, TTRPG, Board Game, or Social Event (**our panel and workshop track are full**). Please submit by 8/12 so we can get your event(s) on the schedule.

**Free admission:** attendees who sign up for any combination of 8+ hours of running events, GMing in Games on Demand, or volunteer shifts get a free 4-day badge to attend the con.

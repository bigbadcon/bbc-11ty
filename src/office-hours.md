This year we're adding a new way for creators and companies to connect. Based on the incredible success of the Virtual Office Hours during Big Bad Online, weâ€™re adding in person Office Hours at the con. From Friday to Sunday we'll host dedicated conference room spaces to give industry professionals more opportunities to meet with attendees at the con.

Use the space to offer career advice, answer questions about your products or services, or discuss new ventures with attendees! Build new connections and explore professional opportunities! How you use the space is up to you!

Conference rooms are reserved in two-hour blocks, during which you will have the space to yourselves. These rooms fit up to three tables, allowing you to hold multiple meetings with your team as attendees drop in and out, if desired.

Office Hours offer an approachable environment to meet highly motivated attendees interested in your company. Thank you for considering this opportunity!

If you would like to host office hours, reserve a time by booking into one of the [Office Hours](https://www.bigbadcon.com/events/?categories=Office%20Hours) events.

If you would like to attend office hours, we'll have a listing of all the companies and individuals hosting them (along with times and locations) as the con gets closer.

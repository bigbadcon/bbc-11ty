## Where are all the games at Big Bad Online?

There are no scheduled games at Big Bad Online. We will have a Big Bad Online discord, separate from our [Community Discord](/community-discord), where people can chat and jump off into games if they like.

## Will you have a Dealer Room or Small Press Showcase at Big Bad Online?

Big Bad Online is a more focused event than our in-person Big Bad Con. With Big Bad Online we wanted to have a different event showcasing diverse speakers from across the game community. We hope to bring back our in-person Big Bad Con in 2022.

## Where did you get all the nifty icons and graphics?

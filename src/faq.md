# Event Submission FAQ

### What's the difference between [Run an Event](https://www.bigbadcon.com/run-an-event/) and [Games on Demand?](<> "https://www.bigbadcon.com/games-on-demand/")

Games on Demand is an offshoot of our TTRPG track that allows players to drop into games at the con rather than booking a slot to play in advance. It's a great place to run games if you'd like to try out different game systems and hangout out with the amazing rangers at Big Bad Con.

We ask Games on Demand GMs to submit two possible games to run during a time slot. At the start of that time slot, players will come to the event space and pick between the games the GMs have prepped.

More detailed information on both tracks here:

[Games on Demand FAQ](/games-on-demand-how-it-works/){.icon-games-on-demand}

### When will I hear back after I've submitted an event?

Our event coordinators should reach out to you within two weeks. If you haven't heard back by then, feel free to email us at events@bigbadcon.com to inquire.

### I'd like to demo a game I made. What's the best way to do that?

* If you'd like to run short (under two hour) demos in the large ballroom, you can book a time slot in the [Small Press Showcase](https://www.bigbadcon.com/small-press-showcase/) once sign ups open (note: you will need a badge to book in the showcase).
* If you'd like to run full length games, you can run up to two sessions either [on our schedule](https://www.bigbadcon.com/run-an-event/) or in [Games on Demand](https://www.bigbadcon.com/games-on-demand/).

### When are games scheduled?

We schedule all games after event submissions close on 7/31. You should hear back by 8/15 with your schedule.

# Website FAQ

### Who built the website?

The front-end of the website is built by hand using the static site generator [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). The back-end is a combination of markdown files for static content, serverless functions, and a bespoke event manager data service. It is a collaboration of:

* [Colin Fahrion](/staff/#colin-fahrion): Site architecture, design, front-end development, and some writing
* [Jeremy Tidwell](/staff/#jeremy-tidwell): Back-end development and event manager API
* [Sean Nittner](/staff/#sean-nittner): Writing and the wisdom of years of Big Bad Con experience

### Where did you get all the wonderful graphics?

The character illustrations of Red and The Wolf are done by [Eden Parkinson](https://eden-parkinson.com)

The Logo and other design graphics are done by [Colin Fahrion](/staff/#colin-fahrion)

The [SVG icons](/icons) are combination of stock, thanks to [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/license) and [Icomoon](https://icomoon.io), and some additional svg art by Colin Fahrion.

# Big Bad Online FAQ

### Where are all the games at Big Bad Online?

There are no scheduled games at Big Bad Online. We will have a Big Bad Online 2023 Discord the day of the event where people can chat and jump off into games if they like. You can register for the Big Bad Online Discord [here](/register). Note this is separate Discord from our year-round [Community Discord](/community-discord).

## Will Big Bad Con return in-person in 2022?

Signs are pointing towards yes! We're hosting Big Bad Online earlier in the year so we can prepare for an in person Big Bad Con in October. More details coming soon!

## Will there be a Dealer Room or Small Press Showcase at Big Bad Online?

Big Bad Online is a more focused event than our in-person Big Bad Con. With Big Bad Online we wanted to have a different event showcasing diverse speakers from across the game community. Several small press designers will be speakers at this event. We hope to bring back our in-person Big Bad Con in 2022, with a lively dealer area and small press spotlight.

## Where are all the games at Big Bad Online?

There are no scheduled games at Big Bad Online. We will have a Big Bad Online 2022 Discord the day of the event where people can chat and jump off into games if they like. You can register for the Big Bad Online Discord [here](/register). Note this is separate Discord from our year-round [Community Discord](/community-discord).

## Is Big Bad Con an official non-profit? Are my donations tax deductible?

Yes! Big Bad Con is an official 501(c)(3) non-profit! Donations are tax deductible and we count as a charitable organization for volunteering. For more information on our non-profit status see [Proof of 501(c)(3) Status](/non-profit).

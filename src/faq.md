## Who built the website?

The front-end of the website is built by hand using the static site generator [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). The back-end is a combination of markdown files for static content, serverless functions, and a bespoke event manager data service. It is a collaboration of:

 * [Colin Fahrion](/staff/#colin-fahrion): Site architecture, design, front-end development, and some writing
 * [Jeremy Tidwell](/staff/#jeremy-tidwell): Back-end development and event manager API
 * [Sean Nittner](/staff/#sean-nittner): Writing and the wisdom of years of Big Bad Con experience

## Where did you get all the wonderful illustrations and graphics?

The Logo and other design graphics are done by [Colin Fahrion](/staff/#colin-fahrion)

The [SVG icons](/icons) are combination of stock, thanks to [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/license) and [Icomoon](https://icomoon.io), and some additional svg art by Colin Fahrion.

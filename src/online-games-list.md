* For the Queen: https://www.evilhat.com/home/for-the-queen/ 
While a Roll20 version is available, you can also play with your physical copy and your computer video! Have whoever has the deck of cards facilitate the game by drawing the card for folks and holding up for whoeverâ€™s turn it is to view. Also, have everyone take an index card and draw an X onto it, so they can simply hold the X up to the screen to indicate that they want to X a card out.

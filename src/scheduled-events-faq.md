### Submitting and Scheduling Events

Our scheduled RPGs, LARPs, board games, panels, and workshops are the core of Big Bad Con!

* Games and events can be submitted here<!-- (https://www.bigbadcon.com/run-an-event/)--> until 7/31. Attendees who sign up for any combination of 8+ hours of running events, GMing in Games on Demand, or volunteer shifts get a free 4-day badge to attend the con.
* After an event is submitted, our coordinators will review it (usually within two weeks) and follow up the the GM, facilitator, or speaker with any questions we have or requests for changes if needed.
* Once an event is approved, it will appear on our schedule [here](https://www.bigbadcon.com/events/).
* After submissions close, our event coordinators will schedule all the events, confirm them with the GMs, facilitators and speakers, and then publish the event times and locations!

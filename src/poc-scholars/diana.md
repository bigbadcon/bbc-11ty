Diana is a content creator based out of Bend, Oregon. Her open and honest style of content covers a variety of topics, but primarily focuses on making D\&D and other TTRPGs more accessible to marginalized groups (particularly low-income and Latine communities) by spreading news of free resources and DIY gaming materials, sharing easy worldbuilding ideas, and providing queer Latine representation in nerdy spaces. Her goal is to lower barriers to gaming and show that anyone at all can use TTRPGs to engage with friends and discover themselves.

Layla Bahmanziari (zhe/zer/they/them) is a TTRPG designer, performer, and producer with a background in professional theatre (The Goodman, Milwaukee Rep, First Floor Theater) and writing (The Flashpaper, Reader’s Digest). Layla’s philosophies toward art focus on authenticity, wonder, and people-first action. Zhe fell in love with TTRPGs and game design for many reasons, but above all: Layla believes the ability to live is rooted in our ability to play. As an extension of that, zhe wants to explore human connection to oneself, others, and life through game design. They are currently working on three game design projects and their own production channel.

Omar Najam is a writer, director, improviser, ttrpg player and overall huge nerd. Growing up in the bay area, he wanted to take the worlds of fantasy and science fiction and horror that he saw on the big screens and make them accessible to his friends and family. Fast forward a couple decades (and a few years of film school) and that's exactly what he's doing. Omar has hosted shows for the El Rey Network, worked on shows for Star Trek and Marvel, but his home is ttrpgs. Whether it's playing a cat pirate in The Borros Saga: Banesbreak, a literal ghost writer in Power Play or an unseelie prince in Dimension 20's A Court of Fey and Flowers, Omar loves finding that childhood fun in stories and seeing where that takes us. Also he has a cat and knits.

Hello i'm Gio, I'm a Filipino Canadian videogame dev QA by day and concept artist/illustrator by night!Â I specialize in hardsurface mechanical illustrations. My past work includes illustrations on Cyberpunk Red, Iron Widow, Maharlika RPG, and Into the Motherlands. I'm a big fan of mecha and love to share that energy through my art.

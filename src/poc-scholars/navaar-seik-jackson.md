Navaar is a New Mexico based game designer, writer and podcaster for tabletop roleplaying games. He started out with the Secret Nerd Podcast, and through his interviews with marginalized creators, began dipping his toes into the world of game design. Now, he is a published author and designer with his original game The Corrupted, and is working to add his voice to other projects as well. As he continues to host and participate in the podcasting space (Know Direction, An Unwavering Force), he is also busy working on more independent TTRPGs, and finding ways to help and uplift other marginalized creators!

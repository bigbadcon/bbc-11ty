Willy is an amalgam of game design, whimsy, and funposting. Willy has worked with Niantic, MCDM, 2CGaming, Ghostfire Gaming, and EN World on a variety of gaming fare (more often than not slipping in clowns and frogs wherever possible). You can also find a lot of Willy's work on the DMs Guild, such as *The Book of House* and *Build-A-Were Workshop*. But more often than not, you can find Willy causing problems on Twitter @TheWillyboo.

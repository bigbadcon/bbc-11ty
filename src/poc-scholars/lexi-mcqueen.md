Lexi (AKA @blackgirlmage) is a powerhouse Game Master, performer, streamer, musician, coder, writer, and lover of all things Tabletop. She loves worldbuilding, screenwriting, analyzing story, creating and playing in Actual Plays, and bringing energy and joy to any project she picks up. All she wants is to play and run games, see her scripts on a silver screen, become a pirate, and teach her dog how to roll a D20.

Jabari Weathers is a Baltimore based illustrator, writer and game designer focused primarily on tabletop roleplaying and analogue games. You may have seen their imagery in Dungeons and Dragons 5e, the Bluebeard's Bride tarot of servants and many other indie roleplaying releases, and you may have read their words in Dungeons and Dragons 5e, Pathfinder 2e, Betrayal at House on the Hill 3e and many other indie releases. In their spare time they like to DJ for the humans, as it helps them blend into this mortal world from the seeking eyes beyond the veil.

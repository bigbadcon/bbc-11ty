My name is Jonathan Perez Galvan, previously a Regional Talent Acquisition Manager, but now I’m your representative for LatinosAgainstSpookyShit. I’m currently based on the West coast in Nevada, but I was born in Ensenada, Mexico, and raised in Bellevue, WA. I’ve been playing video games for as long as I can remember but I’ve only been in the TTRPG space for the last 15 years. I’ve been fortunate enough to have been a part of various actual play campaigns that are currently hosted online, while still finding spaces at peoples tables to continue telling amazing and intricate stories. My goal within the TTRPG community is to give a voice to those who may have felt they didn’t have one; to allow stories to be told that couldn’t be told by anyone else before due to misrepresentation or total lack thereof. I want to create stories allowing people to connect with their roots and their heritage. Whether it’s personal identity or cultural identity, I look forward to sculpting worlds that allow people the safety and comfort to explore both. As a gamer, both in digital or pen-and-paper, I enjoy the art of storytelling and character design and development. I stream RPG games to my community so that we can experience carefully crafted story arcs together, some for the first time. I look forward to growing in this space and working with many other creators to keep bringing our communities the best and safest experiences possible.

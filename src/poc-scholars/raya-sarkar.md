Raya is a freelance illustrator and tattoo artist based in Mumbai, India. Traditional inks being a favorite medium to work in, she can often be found working her G-Nib into the dead of night. As a feminist and animal lover, Raya wants her art to help pave the way for a brighter, more accepting, and more tolerant future through the visual narratives she creates. Her hobbies include long walks, reading comics, playing D&D, and befriending as many animals as she possibly can

Poorna is a TTRPG content creator, aspiring writer and freelance editor who stumbled into the world of TTRPGs four years ago and has been consumed by it ever since. She hails from southern and western India and has never met a bookshelf she didn't covet. In the rare moments she isn't distracted by fantasy fiction and the brilliant world of board games, she rambles about mental health in her slice-of-life webcomic, Meta Cheez. There is only so much time she can go without caffeination before language processing becomes insurmountable.

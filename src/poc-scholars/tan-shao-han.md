A proud descendant of seafaring peasants, jungle fighters, and coffee merchants, Shao divides his days between making games inspired by SEAsian histories and teaching history in SEAsian universities. A longtime supporter of the RPGSEA (Roleplaying Games Southeast Asia) dream, Shao mostly works on his own games at Curious Chimeras, and has also worked for Evil Hat, Paizo, Pelgrane, and Wizards of the Coast.

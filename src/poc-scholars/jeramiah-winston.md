I'm a proud Black Illustrator and Graphic Designer, born and raised in Inglewood, CA. I love creating fantasy illustrations, character art, and portraits! I hope to use my art to increase POC representation in media. Aside from making art, I love hip-hop, board games, creative writing, trading card games, and being an enemy of gentrification everywhere.Â

Mars Dave discovered ttrpgs at a drama club meeting in middle school and fell in love. They're a game writer, player, and general enthusiast. They're currently a Creative Writing major at Ringling College of Art and Design, and their understanding of stories has only made their love for ttrpgs stronger. They also love cooking, sewing, and learning new fun facts (feel free to share some if you see them).

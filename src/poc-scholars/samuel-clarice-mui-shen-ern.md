Samuel Clarice Mui Shen Ern (he/any) is a Chinese Malaysian game designer, editor, and computational artist currently based in London whose work explores topics like Christianity, mental health, body horror, self-improvement, and punching monsters with the power of friendship. Their latest projects include Capitalites, an autobiographical GM-less game about young adulthood and asian identity, and Lumen Ryder Core, a fighting-game-inspired, highly customizable tokusatsu game with a pan-genre twist.

Their long-term goal is to use games and playful technology as tools for medicine and education. When theyâ€™re not designing games, you can find them thrift shopping, watching exploitation movies, attending Bible study, listening to kpop, or being a public menace.

Allegro is a queer mixed Black-Hawaiian-Chinese content creator, performer, and table-top lover based in California. They studied to be an environmental science, with an emphasis on environmental justice and resource management in coastal communities, and theater. Now you can often find them streaming on Twitch by moonlight and working in multi-media science  communications by daylight--all while singing the latest song stuck in their head.

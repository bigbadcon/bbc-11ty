Josh is a TTRPG and Speculative Fiction writer, a PhD student in medieval literature, and an avid Final Fantasy fan. They are currently working on their dissertation about queer knights in Arthurian literature. In their spare time, they can be found playing TTRPGs with their partner and friends, obsessing over their two cats (Artemis and Merlin), and trying – but failing – to get through their massive to-read pile. They have appeared on actual play podcast Proficiency +6 as the voice of Hrolf Sea-Spear, and is currently working on a podcast about LGBT storytellers in the gaming industry as well as a top-down Arthurian-inspired TTRPG. Their ultimate goal is to create fantasy and science fiction gamesand stories that showcase diverse, queer worlds.

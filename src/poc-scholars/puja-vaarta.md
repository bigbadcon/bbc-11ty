Puja Vaarta is queer, Indian-American streamer, writer, and voice actor from Houston, TX. She started out exploring games as a hobbyist, before realizing it could be a career path that would challenge her creativity as a storyteller, actor, and improviser. Growing up as a third culture kid and moving between several different countries as a child, her interests as a performer lie in showcasing her heritage, upbringing, and queerness in all its intricate glory.

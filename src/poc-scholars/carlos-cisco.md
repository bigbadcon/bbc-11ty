Carlos Cisco is a television writer and narrative designer, most recently having written on seasons 4 and 5 of Star Trek: Discovery. His most recent TTRPG design work appears in MCDMs Arcadia and Modiphiusâ€™ Star Trek: Discovery campaign sourcebook. His work can also be found on the DMs guild and in the #iHunt 80s zine. Working in both television and TTRPG design, his ultimate hope is to bridge those two gaps and be a part of adapting table top games for television and film while continuing to develop and hone his craft and build out his network when it comes to game design.

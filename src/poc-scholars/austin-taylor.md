Austin is a professional TTRPG performer, podcaster, and award winning analog game & creative narrative designer. When not up to one of these many things they most likely are watching King of the Hill, playing with their baby, or baking with their partner. Their most recent work as a writer has been on Deimos Academy, Arcon, and Brinkwood; as a performer they can be found on Mind and the Martyr, Transplanar, and too many one shots to count.

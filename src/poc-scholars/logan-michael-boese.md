I like to think of myself as a storyteller. I’m descended from the Apsáalooke tribe, and I have the simple belief that Stories are important. They keep the wisdom of the past, and they impart it to those in the future. (Also they’re really fun!) People will go to amazing lengths for a good story! Storytellers are a cultural cornerstone, and I just want to do my part in keeping those traditions going as best as I can.

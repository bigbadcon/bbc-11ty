Getting to watch, play, or create new stories is something I've always loved doing. Being a big lover of cinema, series, videogames, and acting, it was only a matter of time before I started DMing. In my spare time, I started writing for Trbality, and ended up working on the Vodari book series with them. I have 100+ articles sharing my knowledge on how to GM, as well as some of my own products and games in DMs Guild, DrivethruRPG, and Itch. Additionally, I recently began both writing and participating in podcasts on The Gnome Stew as well. If you want to share one of the stories from your games or talk about tech stuff, don't be scared to say hi!

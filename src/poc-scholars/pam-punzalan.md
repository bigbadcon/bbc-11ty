Pam Punzalan is a queer Filipino designer whose personal work explores themes of intimacy, rebellion, loss, reclamation, and the many different shades of violence. Beyond design, she is an editor, sensitivity & cultural consultant, and advocate for RPGSEA (Roleplaying Games Southeast Asia). Participating in the building of multiple, diverse tables for the tabletop game industry is a deeply important engagement for her, and she has had the pleasure of being part of the organizing teams of Play Without Apology, a queer-centric collective in the Phiilppines, and Session Zero Online, an RPGSEA-centric convention for Southeast Asian game designers and enthusiasts. She has written for Evil Hat, Paizo, Wizards of the Coast, and Renegade Games Studio.

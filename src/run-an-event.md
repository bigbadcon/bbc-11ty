We're looking for games, panels, workshops, and events to make Big Bad Con 2022 our best year yet!

**Free admission:** attendees who sign up for any combination of 8+ hours of running events, GMing in Games on Demand, or volunteer shifts get a free 4-day badge to attend the con.

Event Submission is open for time slots still free in the calendar (presently all time slots are open but there is limited availability Friday and Saturday afternoons 2pm-6pm )

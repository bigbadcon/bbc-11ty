We're looking for games, panels, workshops, and events to make Big Bad Con 2023 our best year yet! We welcome indie and small press games, including established titles and new games in playtest.

**Free admission**: attendees who sign up for any combination of 8+ hours of running events, GMing in Games on Demand, or volunteer shifts get a free 4-day badge to attend the con.

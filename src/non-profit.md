A few folks have noticed that if they donate to Big Bad Con their contributions are tax deductible! **Yes!**

Also, several employers offer their employees time off to volunteer at charitable organizations. **Yes, we qualify for this too!**

If you require proof of Big Bad Con’s 501(c)(3) status, there are several ways to get it.

1. You can just list our Federal EIN number: 81-2912392. For most folks, that’s all that’s needed.
2. If you want to go a bit deeper, you can also provide our [IRS Determination letter](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wkte3s1qwi21tsh/IRS%20Determination%20Letter.pdf?dl=0).
3.

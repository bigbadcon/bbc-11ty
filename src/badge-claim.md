Badges have been printed and badge claim is now closed. If you pledged for a badge during the crowdfunding campaign and weâ€™re not able to redeem your code, we can make a manual badge for you at the con. 

Please note: Big Bad Con is completely sold out so we can only issue badges to existing backers. 

<!--Badge codes are available from Backerkit in your [digital downloads](https://big-bad-con-2023.backerkit.com/backer/digital_rewards).-->

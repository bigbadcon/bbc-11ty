We've reached 100% capacity and badge claims are now closed. All badges have now been printed and we're unable to add any more.

If you pledged during the crowdfunding campaign and we're unable to claim your code, please email info@bigbadcon.com and after the con we'll be able to either add your pledge to the scholarship fund or send a refund. We hope that you can make it out in 2024.

<!--Badge codes are available from Backerkit in your [digital downloads](https://big-bad-con-2023.backerkit.com/backer/digital_rewards).-->

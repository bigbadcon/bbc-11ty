While Go Play NW does not have an association with a specific hotel this year, Seattle boasts a wide variety of hotels suitable for a weekend stay. Sadly, the neighborhood our venue is located in (Beacon Hill) does not have any within it. Fortunately, however, the venue is right next to the Beacon Hill transit center, and so accessible to any hotel on or near the Link Light Rail. 

We have compiled a list of places to stay within a half mile of the light rail and a few fun ones further afield. Many also choose to stay in an airbnb, and we encourage folks to find and coordinate shared lodging over our Discord, if desired.

Our list is organized by neighborhood and ascending distance to the venue via the light rail.

**On the light rail**
* [International District/Chinatown](#international-district-chinatown)
* [Belltown/Downtown](#belltown-downtown)
* [Capitol Hill](#capitol-hill)
* [University District](#university-district)
* [Northgate](#northgate)

**Farther afield**
* [Capitol Hill](#capitol-hill-far)
* [Ballard/Freemont](#ballardfremont-far)
* [Budget](#on-a-budget)

# On the light rail
## International District/Chinatown{#international-district-chinatown}

* [Hostelling International Seattle at the American Hotel](https://www.americanhotelseattle.com/): A basic hostel for those on a budget; very close to International District/Chinatown Station and one of the closer options to the venue. No air conditioning, but all rooms are provided with fans.
* [Panama Hotel and Tea House](https://www.panamahotelseattle.net/): Booked, oddly, though Airbnb; a historic teahouse and Japanese bathhouse, located close to the station. Another good place to stay on a budget, but the baths are gendered and shared; there is no air conditioning; and the building is old!

## Belltown/Downtown{#belltown-downtown}

* [Mayflower Park Hotel](https://mayflowerpark.com/): Pricey but around the corner from Westlake Station.
* [Kasa The Oxford Seattle](https://kasa.com/properties/kasa-the-oxford-seattle): Three-night minimum, a bit pricey but offers options for kitchen/multi-person stay. A half-mile walk to the station.
* [PaliHotel](https://www.palisociety.com/hotels/seattle): Still spendy, but much less so; a half-mile walk to the station.
* [Hotel Five - A Staypineapple Hotel](https://www.staypineapple.com/hotel-five-seattle-wa): One of a chain of small hotels; a half-mile walk to the station.
* [Hotel Max](https://www.provenancehotels.com/hotel-max-seattle): Very close to the station; mid-line prices for downtown.
* [The Moore](https://www.moorehotel.com/): A wide price range for rooms available, from European-style rooms with a bathroom in the hall to suites. It is located above the historic concert venue. A note to the wise: this hotel does not have air conditioning. Also about a half-mile walk to the station.
* [Green Tortoise Hostel](https://greentortoise.net/): The least luxe and cheapest of the options, but close to the station; a wide range of accommodations is available. Rooms do not have air conditioning, but a fan is provided for each bed.

## Capitol Hill{#capitol-hill}

* [Sonder The Boylston](https://www.sonder.com/destinations/seattle/the-boylston): A bit more expensive than The ART INN, below, but only a half-mile walk to Capitol Hill Station, with updated rooms in an older building. Features accessible rooms front and center.
* [Silver Cloud Hotel - Seattle Broadway](https://www.silvercloud.com/seattlebroadway/): Not the cheapest option, but it is located very close to some fun things and right next to the First Hill Streetcar running between Capitol Hill Station and International District/Chinatown Station (or a half-mile walk to Capitol Hill Station).

## University District{#university-district}
* [College Inn Hotel](https://www.collegeinnseattle.com/): Recently remodeled, but in a historic building. Features a wide array of rooms, including European-style rooms with shared baths. A half-mile walk to U District Station.
* [University Inn - A Staypineapple Hotel](https://www.staypineapple.com/university-inn-seattle-wa): The more affordable of two closely located hotels from the Staypineapple chain. Located close to the station.
* [Graduate Seattle](https://www.graduatehotels.com/seattle/): By far the most fun option in the University District, this hotel costs a bit more, but has a cool bar on the top floor, The Mountaineering Club, and a quality cafe at the bottom. Right across the street from the station.

## Northgate{#northgate}
* [Hampton Inn & Suites Northgate](https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/seanghx-hampton-suites-seattle-northgate): Moderate price; very close to Northgate Station, but far from fun things for the price.
* [Hotel Nexus Seattle](https://www.bestwestern.com/en_US/book/hotels-in-seattle/hotel-nexus-bw-signature-collection/propertyCode.48191.html): Many accessible, modest rooms. A half-mile walk to the station, but the more affordable of the two Northgate hotels.

# Farther afield (off the beaten track){#farther-afield}
These options are not as close to the light rail, but they are of note for their lower room rates and/or whimsy.

## Capitol Hill{#capitol-hill-far}
* [The ART INN Seattle](https://www.theartinn.com/locations/seattle/): A moderately priced inn in Capitol Hill close to our old venue, Seattle University. Although it is far from the light rail, it is a half-mile walk from a 20-minute bus ride to the venue on the 60 bus; a good consideration for folks who donâ€™t mind the bus. 

## Ballard/Fremont{#ballardfremont-far}
* [Hotel Hotel Hostel](https://hotelhotel.co/): The most expensive and trendiest hostel on this list, also features the most deluxe and private options, located very close to Fremont staples like the Dumpling Tzar. Regular buses a block away connect to the light rail via either the U District (routes 31 or 32 northbound) or Westlake (routes 40 or 62 southbound).
* [Ballard Inn](https://www.ballardinnseattle.com/): A small hotel in a 100-year-old remodeled bank featuring a wide range of rooms in a trendy part of Ballard. Transit will take around an hour to Centilia, via either the 44 bus to U District Station or the 40 bus to Westlake Station.

## On a budget{#on-a-budget}
There are a number of motels along Aurora Ave for those on a tighter budget, with room rates closer to $150/night. Here are a couple options:

* [Marco Polo Motel](https://marcopolomotel.net): A modest motel within walking distance of Friday Afternoon Tea; about 45 minutes from the venue via either the 5 bus or RapidRide E bus both headed downtown to Westlake Station.
* [Days Inn by Wyndham Seattle](https://www.wyndhamhotels.com/days-inn/seattle-washington/days-inn-seattle-north-of-downtown): Just north of Greenlake, this 2-star hotel is within a mile of some great restaurants, but far from the venue. It is a five-minute walk to the 45 bus connecting to the light rail at Roosevelt Station.
* [Travelodge by Wyndham Seattle](https://www.wyndhamhotels.com/travelodge/seattle-washington/travelodge-seattle-north-of-downtown): Another 2-star hotel in Greenlake. Like the Days Inn above, it is within a mile of some great restaurants, but far from the venue. It is also a five-minute walk to the 45 bus connecting to the light rail at Roosevelt Station.

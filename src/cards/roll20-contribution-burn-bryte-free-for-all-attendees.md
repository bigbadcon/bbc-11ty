The incredibly generous folks at [Roll20](https://roll20.net/ "Roll20") have offered a free copy of [Burn Bryte](https://marketplace.roll20.net/browse/bundle/6091/burn-bryte-core-rulebook "Burn Bryte") to all Big Bad Online attendees. Just sign up to attend and you'll get a code (expires 12/31/2021).

_Burn Bryte is a game about hope against all odds and doing whatâ€™s right, even as the Universe burns around you._

_The mechanics are all about telling stories with giant highs, and terrifying oh-crap-we-broke-our-spaceship-lows._

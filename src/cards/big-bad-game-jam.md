We are doing another game jam for Big Bad Con, hosted by [Jenn Martin](https://twitter.com/tenpenjenn). This year's theme is "Games that transcend distance" since the con will be online this year. Make games inspired by the folkloric item [7 League Boots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-league_boots)!

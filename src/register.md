## Virtual Office Hours

This year, in partnership with [Pixel Circus](https://twitter.com/ThePixelCircus), Big Bad Online is hosting Virtual Office Hours where TTRPG industry professionals will meet with creators from marginalized identities to help them advance their careers. The meetings will take place on April 1st (no joke here!) during Big Bad Online. Sounds good?

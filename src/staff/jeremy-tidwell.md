Jeremy Tidwell is a game player, game designer, software developer, photographer, and general nerd-about-town. He has written [_Companions_](http://www.companionsaw.org/), a social fiction about the feelings of time travellers, and has collaborated on several _Mage 2nd Edition_ products for White Wolf. He is quite affable, and occasionally smells of lychee fruit!

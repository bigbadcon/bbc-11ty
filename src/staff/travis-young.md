Travis a nerd of wide interests. His day job involves kicking websites until he figures out where they're broken, making him a critical member of Go Play NW's Tech Committee, although sometimes we wonder if the things he finds were really broken in the first place or if it was the kicking the did them in. He's based somewhere between Seattle and the Canadian border and wants to assure you that he's definitely *not* an automaton.

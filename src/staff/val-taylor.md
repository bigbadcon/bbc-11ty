Val (she/they) is a screenwriter, project manager, gamer of all varieties, and knower of whale facts. When not working in her full-time role as a communications manager, Val is either furiously rewriting a screenplay, designing her next TTRPG character, or volunteering as CFO for Sunbloom Media Arts Center, a non-profit dedicated to growing the games industry into a safer and more equitable space for people of color. Val was a 2018-19 fellow of LMU and Film Independentâ€™s Incubator Lab, and her writing has advanced in the Austin Film Festival, Outfest Screenwriting Lab, MACRO Episodic Lab, and the HUMANITAS fellowship. As a long-time writer and short-time game designer, her latest obsession is exploring the differences and similarities of storytelling across mediums and how format affects experience.

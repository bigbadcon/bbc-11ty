Jeeyon Shim (she/her) is a nonwhite, queer roleplaying game designer from both coasts of the continental United States. Sheâ€™s lived in Oakland, California for about a decade and the greater Bay area for even longer, where she teaches wilderness survival skills and land connection through larping. Her work focuses on bridging the alienation modern urban people often feel from the land and their roots, examining the overlap of race dynamics in land access and larp access, and immersion in the sacred aspects of (re)connecting with the land.

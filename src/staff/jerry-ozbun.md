I grew up a feral child in rural Oregon. In 7th grade I traded my beloved Transformers collection for a set of AD\&D books. It's the best trade I ever made. Since then, I’ve played TTRPGs of every flavor. Recently my favorite TTRPGs have been Indie titles like The Watch, The Very Good Dogs of Chernobyl, and MASKS.

I first attended BigBadCon 2017 and over that week fell in love with the con and the people there. In 2019 I joined the Rangers, and generally got underfoot until someone asked me to do something helpful, probably to get me out from underfoot.

I am temporarily relocated from Eugene to Hillsboro Oregon. I get together with my friends in Eugene for online games weekly. I also occasionally drive down for a meatspace session of something light every few weeks. I'm very excited to be a part of the BBC team and look forward to seeing all of you.

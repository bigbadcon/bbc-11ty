Ezra Denney (He/Him) is a lifelong gamer (in just about any form) but especially loves boardgames. He is thrilled to see the boardgame offerings at Big Bad Con explode over the past few years, and wants to keep the momentum going. He especially loves playing game sommelier, so if you are looking for a game to play, come ask and he will definitely have recommendations for you. You can watch him play boardgames with his pals at [**Quests & Chaos**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHH6FUptua5O34hqPhQWSxw) on twitch or Youtube.

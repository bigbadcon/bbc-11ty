Kona is an avid ttrpg player, GM, and designer with particular passion for rules-lite games that focus on interpersonal relationships, character arcs, and emotional turmoil; her favorite games are Royal Blood, Thirsty Sword Lesbians, and For the Queen. When she is not playing, she performs enchantments on computers. She loves the color purple, heists, and bats. If you see her, offer to run a game of Blood Heist for her!

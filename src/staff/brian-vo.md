Brian is a gamer, writer, and cook based in Portland, OR. A huge fan of the Powered by the Apocalypse system, he likes to try out other versions but finds comfort in coming back home to Dungeon World at the end of the day. Spends times dreaming and executing on new recipes in his free time, and also finding ways to create food based tributes to the geeky things he loves.

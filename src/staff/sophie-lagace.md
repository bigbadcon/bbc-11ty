Sophie Lagacé has been gaming for so long that she thinks of THAC0 as “that new-fangled acronym.” She likes playing, game-mastering, organizing, reviewing, tinkering with, and writing about tabletop games, especially role-playing games.

She has written for [**Atlas Games**](http://blog.atlas-games.com/), [**Evil Hat Productions**](https://www.evilhat.com/home/), [**Generic Games**](https://genericgames.co.nz/), [**Vigilance Press**](http://www.vigilancepress.com/), and [**ZombieSmith**](https://www.zombiesmith.com/), and is currently working on game supplements for Vigilance Press and Atlas Games.

She also is the Fate line developer and project manager for Evil Hat Productions.

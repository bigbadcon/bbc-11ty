Just an amorphous blob that likes to squeeze through various gaming and social circles. I currently run Games on Demand at Strategicon in Los Angeles (Twitter: @strategicon), and help manage Story Games Glendale (Twitter: @SGGlendale). I float in the space between education and games and technology. I like to occasionally hack games and make cheat sheets and some of those may appear at [https://tgurantz.itch.io/](https://tgurantz.itch.io/ "https://tgurantz.itch.io/").

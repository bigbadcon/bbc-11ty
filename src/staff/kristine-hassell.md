Kristine’s (she/her). Born in a Friday Night Lights-esque town to a dragon mother and a polar bear father, Kristine’s nerd education began early by reading comics aloud with her dad and playing games on their Commodore 64. When she wasn’t gallivanting at the arcade, she was rollerskating until sunset or lost in books for days. Kristine plays in several long running RPGs and while mercurial at times, she loves dim sum, music, K-pop, stickers, macarons, board/role playing/video, and dark wave. Geek flexes include: walking the red carpet at the world premiere/attending the after party for Serenity, and being invited to attend the final KITH taping at the CBC.

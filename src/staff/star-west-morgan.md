Born and raised in Hawaii, Star took a spin through the continental US for a few years to take in the sights, sounds, and rain of Seattle. More mad scientist than engineer, Star is just technical enough to be dangerous, and it's baffling that anyone still lets him near a computer. When he's not tinkering with Go Play's tech, Star tinkers in game design with games like [_Wanderlust_](https://starwest.itch.io/wanderlust), [_Streets of Fire_](https://starwest.itch.io/streets-of-fire), and upcoming project _The Glass of the Crystal Queen._

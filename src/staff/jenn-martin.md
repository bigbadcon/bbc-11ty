Jenn is a maker, editor, writer, game designer, project manager and geek parent. She has a metaphorical hat collection and wouldn’t have it any other way. She keeps her feet on the ground as the Larp Coordinator for Big Bad Con– where safety and care are central values. She keeps her head in the stars making games about space, curiosity and exploration. You might know her from her time as a host on the [**Jank Cast**](http://jankcast.com/) or as a member of the leadership team of [**Indie+**](http://www.indieplus.org/).

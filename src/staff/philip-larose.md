Phil spends most of his time as the dedicated chef, house keeper, and head scratcher to feline perfection: Nimial. In the rare moments he's not catering to Nimial's every whim, Phil leads Go Play NW's Organizing Committee, serving as the liason between the Board and Go Play NW's day-to-day operations.

Philip is a co-founder and Board member of Go Play NW, and currently leads the Organizing Committee as the liaison between the Board and Go Play NW’s day-to-day operations. He likes to claim this all got started because he joined the *Talislanta* RPG email list back in 1995, although really it starts even before that...it’s a long story. Philip has lived in Seattle long enough to age into adulthood a second time, but not yet as long as he lived in his native New England. Apart from Go Play NW, Philip is a passionate music fan and long-time [KEXP](https://www.kexp.org/) volunteer, a highly skilled editor, and a devoted caretaker of his cat Nimiel

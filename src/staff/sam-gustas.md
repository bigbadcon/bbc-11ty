Sam (he/him) is an information technology servant leader for a county public health plan and a lapsed gamer from the THAC0 days. Having reignited his passion for table top gaming after buying a copy of Talisman on a whim with the love of his life, he now extols the virtues of how every shuffle is valid and that each move is business, not malice during a game.

Sandra entered the realm of Gaming later in life when she turned 40, and she has never looked back! At that time she also embraced all the geeky things she had always loved like Star Wars, Minions, Hello Kitty, Marvel, Wonder Woman, and more. Sandra passionately loves board games, truly enjoys RPGs, and pre-COVID enjoyed LARPs as well. From August to June she is a Speech-Language Pathologist at an Elementary School in the South Bay Area. She works with General Education students as well as Severely Handicapped students. Sandra loves sharing her geekiness with her students through her sense of style and classroom decorations, and enjoys bringing her love of games to her therapy sessions. She is lucky to love her job, and the wonder of helping students learn to 'speak' verbally or with technology.

Ken â€” he/him is a Linux senior systems administrator. He's also a writer, photographer, and amateur mycologist.

He's definitely not a coffee snob.

His favorite role playing games are usually narrative in nature, but he's always willing to explore new things.

Ken loves learning very old skills, like how to make cordage from stuff you find in your neighbors yard waste piles.

Kilted Ken is a faithful sidekick to Princess Izzy The Wonder-Dog.

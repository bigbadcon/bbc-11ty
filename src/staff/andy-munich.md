Andy (he/him) is a cis-het-white-male who’s tired of his own demographic dominating gaming spaces. Through his work with GeekGirlCon, The GeekGirlScouts, and Big Bad Con, he’s tried to bring the thrill of RPGs and Story Games to anyone he can reach. He’s very fortunate in having amazing friends and colleagues helping him in this endeavor. Also, he was once transformed into a dwarven puppet for four hours; ask him about it someday.

Andy lives in his own head, which is located in Seattle.

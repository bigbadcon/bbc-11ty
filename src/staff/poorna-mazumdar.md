Poorna (she/her) went to the TTRPG milliner's and emerged with many, many hats. At the moment, she's wearing a fascinator that screams : writer. On occasion, she has been known to don an editorial top hat, a process management trilby, even a jaunty AP beret. She has a soft spot for bookish folx and bedlam.Â She hails from southern and western India and has never met a bookshelf she didn't covet. In the rare moments she isn't distracted by fantasy fiction and the brilliant world of board games, she rambles about mental health in her slice-of-life webcomic, Meta Cheez. There is only so much time she can go without caffeination before language processing becomes insurmountable.

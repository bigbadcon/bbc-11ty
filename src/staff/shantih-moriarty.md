Shantih Moriarty (she/her) has been attending BBC for seven years. An avid rpg fan from her early years (D\&D in a box, anyone?), she was introduced to board games by rpg geeks who were also addicted to cubes. And what better place to try and share cube addiction then her favorite gaming convention! Born in San Jose but lived pretty much everywhere, Shantih is a Real Estate agent in Silicon Valley and before that was involved in the book industry.

I’m helping with the Community Standards. I’m super happy to be here helping out. I’m a factotum, bouncing from job to job. I’ve done everything from working in tech as a project manager to working the door at bars to working the floor at Wizard World Comic Cons.

I play a lot of games and I’m heavily involved in the indie video game scene here in Austin, TX with the [**Juegos Rancheros**](http://juegosrancheros.com/)crew. But my first true gaming love is tabletop RPGs. I also spent 7 years in boffer larps.

In my spare time I’m a photographer and a stunt man. The best stunt bit I’ve done was a gritty [**Super Smash Bros Mario vs Luigi battle**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5kttOQ5rEQ)

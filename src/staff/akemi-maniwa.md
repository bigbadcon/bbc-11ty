Akemi (she/they) is an SF Bay Area based indie ttrpg creator, actual play performer, occasional cosplayer, and penguin enthusiast. By day she makes video games, in the off hours plays more analog games (sometimes digitally). They can often be found doing aikido or chilling at home with their dogs. At one point in their life her goal was to be a Power Ranger, Big Bad Con Ranger is a worthy alternative, even though it doesn't come with a cool transformation sequence.

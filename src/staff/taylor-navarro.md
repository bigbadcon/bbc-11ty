Taylor Navarro (she/her) is a Puerto Rican-British TTRPG project manager, game designer, editor, and two-time Big Bad Con POC Scholarship recipient (2022 & 2023). Her great loves are her children, dice, kobolds, her husband, and knitting/crochet (probably in that order!) Born a support character, Taylorâ€™s goals are to pay it forward and help others find joy and success in tabletop games.

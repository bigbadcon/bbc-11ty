Gina (she/her) is a writer/planner/project/manager and ttrpg enthusiast who streams, hosts, plays, runs, play tests, and makes games on the sly to someday release into the geeky wild. She’s an avid consumer of media and eater of books with a background in mathematics, English, creative writing, and education. She is committed to equity for excluded and marginalized people and to cultivating safe spaces in gaming and beyond. Gina’s north coast roots often show, though she followed the sun and transplanted to the west coast in the last century. She is an irrevocable hopeful optimist and wouldn’t have it any other way.

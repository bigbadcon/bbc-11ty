Heather “DandySprat” Rose (she/her) pretends to be an adult during the day by administratively assisting a research group at UCSF. She got a Switch Lite for Christmas and no one has seen her since. Legend has it she is sometimes social if cheese is involved. Un-official planner of Too Many Things, she adores the rangers of Big Bad Con, planning gamer camp outs, crochet, her cat, and quilting.

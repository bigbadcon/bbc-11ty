Red is totally (definitely) an Agender human and not just 4 racoons in a trenchcoat. By day, they play games of the tabletop and video varieties with their two cats Remy & Izabelle. By night Red works in Hospitals, Ambulances, and Bars all over Seattle making sure people are taken care of in any facet they might require! In their down time, Red is an avid cinephile and labor organizer, and they strive to make any space they inhabit a safe, inclusive, and welcoming environment for folx of all walks of life.

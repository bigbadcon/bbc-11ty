Annabelle Blackman is a local youth librarian in the East Bay. In 2014, she discovered modern hobby games alongside her then 3 year old, and she was smitten ever since. She attends board game conventions for professional development as well as for funzies. Professionally, Annabelle has a particular interest in games that appeal to intergenerational groups of varying literacy levels, and English language fluency. Fun Fact: she had no idea indie TTRPGs existed until she volunteered for Big Bad as a Board Game Ranger in 2019. BBC's welcoming community has really defined what story games are for her, and she is always learning.

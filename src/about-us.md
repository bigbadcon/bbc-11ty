Go Play NW is an annual weekend event where folks come together to play tabletop role-playing, story, board, and card games.

Meet new people! Play new games!

## History

Go Play NW was founded in 2007 to promote and foster role-playing/story games. For that purpose we brought together long-time role-playing-game hobbyists, game designers, and also people new to gaming for a weekend of gaming fun and fellowship in Seattle. The event was such a great success that even before it was over, it was obvious we’d be holding another one.

## Gaming

Go Play NW always features a mix of scheduled and ad-hoc gaming. Many players do both, though some prefer one over the other.

For scheduled gaming, see our game scheduling forum. You may sign up for games, drop out of games, or offer to run a game through the forums up until 1 week before Go Play. There will also be signup boards with new games offered throughout the convention.

For pickup gaming, there will be a pitch session in the Ballroom before each gaming slot (also known as “the donut”) with multiple games available that you can join. Show up a few minutes early.

## Game Masters

We rely heavily on our community to bring the fun for everyone. If you’re comfortable facilitating games, we suggest you bring one or two to share. Board games, casual games, and short games are welcome. If you’ve never run a game at a con before, let us know. Go Play NW is a great place to run your first game. We’ll help however we can.

If you’re a game designer, we also have a vibrant playtest community. Playtest games are welcome in the donut and the singup forums. Just be clear that your game is a playtest so people know what to expect.

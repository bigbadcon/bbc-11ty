Thank you for submitting an event! 

* After your event is submitted, our coordinators will review it (usually within two weeks) and follow up.
* Once your event is approved, it will appear on our [events page](/events)
* After submissions close, our event coordinators will schedule all the events, confirm them with you, and then publish the event times and locations!

_Remember you need 8+ hours of running events or volunteer shifts get a free 4-day con badge._ You can submit another event by returning to the [Run an Event form](/run-an-event).

We want you to have maximum access to games at Big Bad Con. Here’s how we do it:

* Event submissions are open from early June through mid-September.
* Events are posted to the site as soon as they're approved, so attendees have plenty of time to see all their options.
* Game signups for Big Bad Con will start on **September 25th at 12:00 PM PDT (GMT-7:00)**, using our **Signup Phase System**, detailed below.
* To sign up for an event, go to the event page, and if there are spaces left, click Book Now at the bottom.

### Not enough games? Too many games?

* We’re proactive during signups! If a game fills up quickly, we'll try to add additional sessions. If a game isn’t filling up, we'll promote it through social media.
* If you have open slots on your schedule, never fear! Swing by the reg desk at the con to see what games still have open slots. We also have [Games on Demand](http://www.bigbadcon.com/games-on-demand/ "Games on Demand at Big Bad Con")—just stop by for new games starting every two hours! And we've got open gaming running all con long!

### Our Signup Phase System

Not everyone is available the moment signups open. So we've instituted Signup Phases, approximately one week apart:

* Phase I (Sunday 9/25 12PM PDT) — Everyone can sign up for a maximum of 2 events.
* Phase II (Monday 10/4 7PM PDT) — Everyone can sign up for 2 more events, a maximum of 4 total.
* Phase III (Saturday 10/8 7PM PDT) — Event signups have no maximum limit.

A few things to note:

* Events marked [All Ages](https://www.bigbadcon.com/events/?cat=all-ages) are available to all attendees, including teens.
* Events not designated all ages are available to adults 18 and up.
* Events you're running, volunteer shifts, and small press showcase events don't count against your limit.
* Some specific events (Wolf Chase, panels, workshops) don’t count against your limit either. They marked with a message "_This event does not count towards your quota_" near the booking button.

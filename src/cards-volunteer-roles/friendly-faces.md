 If you’d like to share your excitement about Go Play NW, become a Friendly Face! Our Friendly Faces welcome attendees as they enter the convention and help them get to where they need to be. They give directions, but also encouragement. A Friendly Face is often an attendee’s first point of contact with convention staff, and helps set the tone for the weekend. Ringer if we need someone to hop in and help kick off a game. Volunteers for this role report to the Programming Committee.

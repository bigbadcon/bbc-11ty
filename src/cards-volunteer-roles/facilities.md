 _In person events only_
Setting up and breaking down at the start and end of each day is critical to pulling off a successful Go Play NW! If you're idea of a good time is showing up a bit early and staying a bit late so you can be free to game the rest of the day, this may be the volunteer role for you! Volunteers for this role report to the Programming Committee.

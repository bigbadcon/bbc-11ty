Games on Demand offers players a roster of games to sign up for at the con and GMs the opportunity to run their favorite RPGs, from the classics to brand new systems (even games in playtest)!

Time slots are four hours long. In each slot you can run either a single 4-hour game or two 2-hour games. Either way we ask that you offer two different games for players to choose. If you would like to offer four games, submit the form twice.

Games on Demand submissions are open until 7/31/2023.

**Free admission**: attendees who sign up for any combination of 8+ hours of running events, GMing in Games on Demand, or volunteer shifts get a free 4-day badge to attend the con.

Games on Demand is full of wonderful GMs who run a whole host of games, with sing ups starting just before each slot!

### How It Works

Games On Demand games will start every two hours, with periodic breaks to give our GMs a rest between games.

**Before games start:**

1. Come by the Contra Costa rooms and check out the games on offer.
2. Pick up a boarding pass from our hosts.
3. If you need extra time during boarding, let our hosts know!

**When Games start:**

1. When your boarding group is called, come to the host table.
2. Pick from the available games
3. Head to the table the host indicates and play a game!

### Schedule

Here the schedule of when games will be starting:

### For Players

Please swing by at least 10 minutes before games start to talk with a Games on Demand host. They can tell you more about what's on offer and answer any questions about the games. They'll also give you a boarding pass to get into games in the next slot.

On the hour the hosts will ask everyone to make some space and then start calling out boarding passes. When your boarding pass is called, give it to the host. You will be able to select a game from the available list.

### For GMs

Your Games on Demand schedule will be listed on the master schedule.

Please arrive a 10 minutes before your schedule time to let the Games on Demand host know you're there and ready to run your games (if any changes need to be made, they can do so there). If you wish to do so, you can indicate that some of the offerings on your menu will not be available for this period.

If you do not get enough players to run your game, feel free to wander the con, or jump into another GoD game that still has available seats, but stay accessible to the host either by being in the room or leaving your cell number, Twitter handle, or other means of getting in touch with you should players show up mid-slot looking for a game.

Your games should end 10 minutes before he next slot to make sure the table is clear and ready for the next game.

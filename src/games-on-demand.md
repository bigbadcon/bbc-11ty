Games on Demand offers players an roster of games to sign up for at the con and GMs the opportunity to try out all their favorites systems! 

Games on Demand time slots are four hours long. In each slot you can run either a single 4-hour game or two 2-hour games. Either way we ask that you offer two different games for players to choose. If you would like to offer four games, submit the form twice.

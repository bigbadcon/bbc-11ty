Big Bad Con is committed to cultivating and supporting a spectacular and diverse gaming community. Part of the way we do that is by collecting donations to our scholarship program.

Our scholarship funds go towards helping women and people from marginalized genders, people of color, disabled, and lgbtqia+ individuals attend the con. We use it to cover hotel rooms ($149+/night), convention badges ($75), and help with other fees. Depending on the number of applicants, we may be able cover full or partial costs.

As of 2024 the POC Programming Track and Big Bad Con scholarship applications have merged. Scholarship recipients of color will be offered the opportunity to attend the POC Meet & Greet.

### Timeline

Big Bad Con is committed to cultivating and supporting a spectacular and diverse gaming community. Part of the way we do that is by collecting donations to our scholarship program.

Our scholarship funds go towards helping women and people from marginalized genders, people of color, disabled, and lgbtqia+ individuals attend the con. We use it to cover hotel rooms ($145+/night), convention badges ($75), and help with other fees. Depending on the number of applicants, we may be able cover full or partial costs.

### Timeline

* Scholarship applications are now open! Application window will close on Saturday, June 15th. [Apply here!](/apply-for-scholarship "Apply for scholarship")

### Contributions

If you would like to contribute to the Scholarship Fund, there are a few ways to do it.

* During crowdfunding (starting soon!) you can back at the scholarship level, or add a scholarship contribution as an add-on to another pledge.
* You can also donate directly via our [PayPal giving fund](https://www.paypal.com/us/fundraiser/charity/1653860).

Any contributions made after September will be set aside for next yearâ€™s fund. Thank you very much for your support!

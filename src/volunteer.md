Go Play NW runs on volunteers! You help us greet folks when they arrive, get them registered, and help them find their way throughout the event. You also get to work with amazing folks. Our volunteers provide an atmosphere of calm during an otherwise hectic weekend of activities. Want to join us? Here's all the details.

**Free admission**:  Anyone who signs up for 8+ hours of volunteer shifts gets a free badge to attend the full event.

## Volunteer roles

Here's all the work we do. If you're ready to engage with our community, consider one of these roles!

**Registration Desk**  
_(In-person only)_  
If you want to be part of the Go Play NW central hub, join the Registration team! The Registration Desk is an often demanding, but always rewarding, position at Go Play NW. Those stationed here help attendees acquire their badge, sign up for scheduled games, and find their way around.

**Friendly Faces**  
If you’d like to share your excitement about Go Play NW, become a Friendly Face! Our Friendly Faces welcome attendees as they enter the convention, answer their questions (or connect them to staff for more assistance), and help them feel comfortable. A Friendly Face is often an attendee’s first point of contact with convention staff, and helps set the tone for the weekend.

**Scheduled Games**  
_(In-person only)_  
If you like paying matchmaker, you'll love helping Go Play NW attendees find the perfect game to add to their schedule, or helping folks interested in running a game get it on the calendar.

**Donut Master of Ceremonies**  
As the Donut MC, you’ll be front and center running the show: calling the Donut to order, providing instructions to facilitators, steering the flow of pitches, and concluding the Donut when pitches are finished. This is an invite-only volunteer role.

**Donut Assistant**  
Running the donut can be tough! That's where our Donut Assistants come in. Help keep the Donut on track by facilitating communication between our Go Play NW attendees and our Donut MCs.

**Facilities**  
_(In-person only)_  
Some folks like being the person behind the curtain, and if that's you, here is your opportunity! Those working Setup or Breakdown need to be able to take direction when offered and rapidly enact plans of action. They’ll be building or dismantling stanchions, putting up or taking down signage, and loading or unloading everything as needed.

**Media**  
_(In-person only)_  
Our media volunteers capture all the action at Go Play NW! If you're a wiz with a camera, media volunteer might be the perfect role for you! This is an invite-only volunteer role.

**Tech Support**  
This is an invite-only volunteer role.

Once you're set up as a Volunteer you'll be able to sign up for our available Volunteer shifts.

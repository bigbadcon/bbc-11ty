Go Play NW runs on volunteers! You help us greet folks when they arrive, get them registered, and help them find their way throughout the event. You also get to work with amazing folks. Our volunteers provide an atmosphere of calm during an otherwise hectic weekend of activities. Want to join us? Here's all the details.

**Free admission**:  Anyone who signs up for 8+ hours of volunteer shifts and/or running games gets a free badge to attend the full event.

## Volunteer roles

Here's all the work we do. If you're ready to engage with our community, consider one of these roles!

### Online events
**Friendly Faces**: If you’d like to share your excitement about Go Play NW, become a Friendly Face! Our Friendly Faces welcome attendees as they enter the convention, answer their questions (or connect them to staff for more assistance), and help them feel comfortable. A Friendly Face is often an attendee’s first point of contact with convention staff, and helps set the tone for the weekend.

**Donut Master of Ceremonies**: As the Donut MC, you’ll be front and center running the show: calling the Donut to order, providing instructions to facilitators, steering the flow of pitches, and concluding the Donut when pitches are finished. You’ll also be in communication with the Donut Chat Mod and Bot PIC during the Donut.

**Donut Chat Mod**: As a Donut Chat Mod, you’ll be facilitating communication between attendees, the Donut MCs, and the Bot PICs.

**Technology Team**: As a Bot PIC, you’ll help ensure the Discord bots we use to manage the Donut all function smoothly. Technical Support

### In-person events

**Registration Desk**: If you want to be part of the Go Play NW central hub, join the Registration team! The Registration Desk is an often demanding, but always rewarding, position at Go Play NW. Those stationed here help attendees acquire their badge, sign up for scheduled games, and find their way about.

**Friendly Faces**: If you’d like to share your excitement about Go Play NW, become a Friendly Face! Our Friendly Faces welcome attendees as they enter the convention and help them get to where they need to be. They give directions, but also encouragement. A Friendly Face is often an attendee’s first point of contact with convention staff, and helps set the tone for the weekend.

**Donut Master of Ceremonies**: As the Donut MC, you’ll be front and center running the show: calling the Donut to order, providing instructions to facilitators, steering the flow of pitches, and concluding the Donut when pitches are finished.

**Donut Assistant**: Running the donut can be tough! That's where our Donut Assistants come in.

**Setup/Breakdown**: If you want to work behind the convention scenes, here is your opportunity! Those working Setup or Breakdown need to be able to take direction when offered and rapidly enact plans of action. They’ll be building or dismantling stanchions, putting up or taking down signage, and loading or unloading everything as needed.

**Technology Team**: If you’d like to make gaming dreams come true for attendees, become a Games on Demand (GoD) host! GoD Hosts run a boarding pass system that allows attendees to queue up for two and four hour drop-in games in a stress-free manner. They manage the queue while also managing player and facilitator expectations.

Once you're set up as a Volunteer you'll be able to sign up for our available Volunteer Shifts.

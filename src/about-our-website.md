The Go Play NW website was built using the [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) static site generator and [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/). It is hosted and deployed via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) with a custom Java Event Management solution behind the scenes that handles all event bookings.

It is a heavily customized fork of the [Big Bad Con](bigbadcon.com/) website originally built by [Colin Fahrion](http://www.twitter.com/colinaut) and [Jerry Tidwell](https://github.com/necanthrope/)

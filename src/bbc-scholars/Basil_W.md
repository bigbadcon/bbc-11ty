Basil Wright (he/they/xe) is a Game Designer and Cultural Consultant who loves puns, fantasy novels, and more bananas and cheese than one person should consume in a lifetime. His game design philosophy is to create games that promote community and have the lowest barrier of entry, so that everyone can enjoy playing games together!

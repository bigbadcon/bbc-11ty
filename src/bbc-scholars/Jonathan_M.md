Jonathan Mendoza is a queer Fil-Am therapist specializing in the intersection between drama therapy and the world of roleplaying games by day, and a designer, dramaturge, performer, producer, and writer by night. That said, you probably know them by their love of the Western genre, their enthusiasm for designing firearms for tabletop roleplaying games at any opportunity, and the poker chips that serve as their calling card--because if you're going to do a bit, commit.

Finch Edmund is a writer and TTRPG creator. You may know their work from co-hosting the podcast Tabletop Book Club, or creating the actual play series Wicked World, or dipping their toes into TTRPG game design, or being silly on TikTok. Theyâ€™re a wearer of many very specific hats, but they consider themself a storyteller above all else.

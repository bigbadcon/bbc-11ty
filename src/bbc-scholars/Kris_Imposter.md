Kris is a queer Brazilian TTRPG Game Master, Player, Producer, Dramaturg, and one of the Founders of Tabletop Tempest - an Actual Play channel created by immigrants and children of immigrants. They are most passionate about integrating intersectional, own-voice stories and adopting cultural folklore to TTRPG narratives. Kris most recently was the GM for Tabletop Tempest's show "Beneath the Surface," which combined Brazilian folklore with themes of generational trauma and redefining family.

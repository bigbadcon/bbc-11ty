Kris (she/they) is a lifelong lover of games in all forms but found her "one true love" in the form of collaborative storytelling through ttrpgs. Most of their contributions have been in the form of AP performances (she's notorious for being unable to turn down a good charity or community-building project). They have also had the great fortune of collaborating on various writing projects, including module writing for a tabletop game for kids in therapeutic and educational settings.

Poorna (she/her) went to the TTRPG milliner's and emerged with many, many hats. At the moment, she's wearing a fascinator that screams: writer. On occasion, she has been known to don an editorial top hat, a process management trilby, even a jaunty AP beret. She has a soft spot for bookish folx and bedlam. She has never met a bookshelf she didn't covet. 

She's one half of Weave Games, a TTRPG outfit based in India.

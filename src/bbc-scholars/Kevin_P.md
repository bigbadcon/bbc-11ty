Kevin wears a lot of hats: including Writer, IT Troubleshooter, Game Designer, Evil Genius, Editor, and Dad.

Known for Princess World and being a kick-ass GM (sometimes even professionally!), Kevin loves to collaborate with others to weave new and surprising worlds together.

Kevin has recently taken up stand-up comedy, under the stage name ""Princess Kevin"", specializing in terrible ventriloquism, off-beat crowd work, colorful tees, and a desire to hoist toxic masculinity on its own petard.

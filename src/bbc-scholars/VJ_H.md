V.J. Harris (they/he/something funny) is a full-time TTRPG designer and Professional Game Master. In their spare time, they make TikTok videos about TTRPGS, play/stream produce TTRPGs over on Twitch across a wide variety of channels, are one of the admins for APOCHROMATIC UNLIMITED, and talk about the bigotry within the TTRPG space (products and communities) and how to combat that.

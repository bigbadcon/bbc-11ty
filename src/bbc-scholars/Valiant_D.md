Valiant Dorian is a Malaysian Desi, transmasculine Actual Play performer, host of the TTRPG talk show Dicey Banter, Twitch streamer and game designer. Fueled by incorrigible youngest sibling energy, he specializes in stories exploring the duality of love & grief, wrath & justice and divinity & monstrosity. When he is not performing and writing, he is beholding the beauty of sun bears and werewolves.

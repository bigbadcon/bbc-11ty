I'm a Games Studies Postgrad with a passion for establishing research into solo RPGs. My research and justifications reach to areas like challenging TTRPG design theory, queer (and specifically trans) games studies, investigating the indie scene within TTRPGs and explaining the benefits of solo RPGs on your mental health. I also have interests in exploring communities as a marginalised person, narratology and ludology.

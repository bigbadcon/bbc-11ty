Morgan is a Canadian TTRPG designer, writer, artist, and cosplayer with a passion for telling queer, spicy, and emotional stories with complex characters. She's written and illustrated third party content for Monster of the Week, Apocalypse Keys, Spire, Heart, and Dungeons & Dragons as well as several indie solo and two-player games like Legendary, and Meet Me Where I Am. In her spare time, she writes romance stories with her friend about their DnD characters and grows vegetables on her balcony.

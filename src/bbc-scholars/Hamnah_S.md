Hamnah Shahid is an award-winning TTRPG performer, producer, and writer. From a queer, agender, Pakistani perspective, they specialize in high-emotion, character-driven narratives. Hamnah strives to make experimental, emotionally-driven art that not only encourages us to question what we think is possible in TTRPGs, but also uplifts marginalized voices seeking to tell their own stories.

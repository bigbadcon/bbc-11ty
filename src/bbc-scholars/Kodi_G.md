Kodi Gonzaga is a creative writer and tabletop roleplaying game designer originally hailing from Atlanta, GA. They are queer, mixed race, disabled, and neurodivergent, and their favorite stories to write, read, and tell usually involve kids and teens with strange powers, lots of trauma, and identities outside the norm. These days, you can find them hanging out in Los Angeles playing games, writing stories, and cuddling with their cute cat Zoey!

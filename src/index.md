### Big Bad Online 2021

Free event for all attendees!

Full 24hrs featuring online events localized for different time zones! The primary content of Big Bad Online will be panels, seminars and hangout areas.

So that we can pay our panelists, cover our upkeep costs, and prepare for 2022, we’ll host a fundraising event in August. We’ll talk more about this as it gets closer!

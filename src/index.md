## Big Bad Con Presents: Story Synth Microgrants

We’re excited to announce a new microgrant program focused on helping marginalized game designers create, publish, and monetize games on the Story Synth platform!

Each microgrant is a $300 award. In addition to those funds, game developers will receive proceeds generated by their games through micropayments.

The grant window is between January 24, 2022 and July 23, 2022 (when we hope to have the games complete) so [apply now](https://www.bigbadcon.com/story-synth-microgrants/)!

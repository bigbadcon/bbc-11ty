## Big Bad Con 2022

**Big Bad Con is returning October 27-30** at the Hyatt Regency near San Francisco Airport. We're so excited to see our friends, meet new people, and play games together!

To cover the costs of hosting the event, we're running an [Indiegogo campaign](https://igg.me/at/bigbadcon2022). There you'll be able to buy a badge, sign up for online games before the con, and secure the illustrious backer pin.

Once we hit our funding level, stretch goal we reach will make the con even better!

To cover the costs of hosting the event, we're running an [Indiegogo campaign](https://igg.me/at/bigbadcon2022). There you'll be able to buy a badge, sign up for online games before the con, and secure the illustrious backer pin.

Once we hit our funding level, stretch goal we reach will make the con even better! --->

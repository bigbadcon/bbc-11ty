## Big Bad Con 2022

**Big Bad Con is returning October 27-30** at the Hyatt Regency near San Francisco Airport. We're so excited to see our friends, meet new people, and play games together! 

To cover the costs of hosting the event, we'll be running an Indiegogo campaign starting June 21. There you'll be able to buy a badge, sign up for online games before the con, and secure the illustrious backer pin! To stay connected and find out more [sign up here.](https://igg.me/at/bigbadcon2022)

For more updates about the con, including COVID safety precautions, game submissions, and hotel info stay tuned to our [blog](/blog)!

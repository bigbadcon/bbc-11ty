## Big Bad Online 2022!

We're delighted to announce Big Bad Online will be returning this year year May 6-7.

As with last year's online event, we'll be streaming 24 hours of amazing, free-to-view panels on a diverse array of TTRPG-related topics, but we can't do it without you. Your contribution will support us in showing off expert conversations on a diverse array of topics and amplifying the voices of marginalized designers, professionals, and players in our TTRPG community.

We're so stoked to present these panels to you this year, and we hope you will help us put on this amazing event,

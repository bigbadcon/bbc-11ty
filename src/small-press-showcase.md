### How it works:

Once you have a badge, head to one of the [showcase events](https://www.bigbadcon.com/events/?categories=Vending), fill out the form to become one of our small press vendors, and then book yourself in vending spots on the schedule (up to 4 time slots).

During that time you can sell your wares, make art, run demos, or otherwise share your creative work with our wonderful attendees. You'll process all sales yourself and the con charges no fees (except getting a badge to attend) to be in the Small Press Showcase.

We have room for up to eight vendors at a time, and each of you will have a 6' long table to display your wares. At the end of your shift, we ask that you clean up for the next vendor coming after you.

More questions. Email **[info@bigbadcon.com](mailto:info@bigbadcon.com)** and we’ll get back to you asap.

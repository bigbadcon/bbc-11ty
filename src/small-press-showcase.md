**Returning from Big Bad Con 2019**, the Small Press Showcase is a space for self publishers, small press, crafters, and artists to vend their games, art, and creative works. The Small Press Showcase is free to any vendor attending the con.

### How it works:

Once you have a **badge**, fill out the **Small Press Vendor Signup form** (still in development) to become one of our small press showcase vendors, then and book yourself in vending spots on the schedule.

During that time you can sell your wares, make art, run demos, or otherwise share your creative work with our wonderful attendees. You’ll process all sales yourself and the con charges no fees (except getting a badge to attend) to be in the Small Press Showcase.

We have room for up to four vendors at a time, and each of you will have a 6′ long table to display your wares. At the end of your shift, we ask that you clean up for the next vendor coming after you.

More questions. Email [**info@bigbadcon.com**](mailto:info@bigbadcon.com) and we’ll get back to you asap.

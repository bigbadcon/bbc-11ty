A community that's quickly turning new players into new Game Masters! How do we do it?

* Hosting: Online & in-person one-shots of DnD and Indie games. Monster design contests and DM prep/workshop streams!
* Selling: Dice Jars, Mystery Dice Bags, and Gachapon dice! (Some may be cursed.)
* Giving Away: Free DnD One-shot Adventure - A heist aboard a cruise ship run by devils!

If you aren't running a game yet, you've been summoned. We'll see you at Kenku Court.

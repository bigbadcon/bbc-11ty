Quests and Chaos produces content for the tabletop gaming industry including actual play live streams, cooperative board games, and role-playing game accessories.

Our first RPG accessory is the Deck of Inspiration, a set of five card decks that enhance the inspiration mechanic of 5e Dungeons and Dragons.  The inspiration decks feature 55 cards to reward  your players for great game play. These are fun one-time use boons that create memorable stories around the table.  The Deck of Un-Inspiration does the opposite, providing fun consequences for bad player behavior.

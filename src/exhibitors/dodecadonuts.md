Dungeons, Dragons, Donuts & Dice. If you love RPGs and you love pastries, you’ll love Dodecadonuts. We make pastry-themed DnD accessories and other merchandise. Guaranteed Gluten and Sugar-free.

* THE “DODECADONUT” - Hand-carved dice boxes that happen to look like donuts. Each donut is held together with magnets and splits open to reveal your dice. Sold with a pink felt bag.
* MAPCARONS - Weighted wooden macarons that hold down your maps. It’s a Map-caron, if you like.
* COFFEE CUP DICE ROLLERS - A coffee cup that’s a dice roller. Drop your dice in the top and the 3d-printed insert bounces it out the side.
* We also have pastry and Donut themed T-shirts, Stickers, Pins and more.

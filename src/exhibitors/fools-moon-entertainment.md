Fool's Moon Entertainment, Inc. (FMEI) is a Canadian company dedicated to giving voice to those communities that are maginalised in the gaming community. Founded over 20 years ago, FMEI has released a number of games, including Fox Magic (which allows one to create their own Japanese fables), Mhar Fantasy (a Medieval alt-Earth), and Widdershins (about lost toys protecting humanity). We are interested in helping indie game designers get their works out into the world or to talk about their work through streaming. We will also be offering select games by House Dok and Penny For A Tale, who share our goals of marginalised representation and whom we have streaming partnerships with.

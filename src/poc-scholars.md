Working with individual and industry donors the POC programming team has raised $50,000 to aid people of color in attending the con by paying for travel, boarding, admission, and related expenses. All recipients are also invited to attend the POC Dinner (Friday night) and Meet & Greet (Saturday night) to connect with industry professionals.

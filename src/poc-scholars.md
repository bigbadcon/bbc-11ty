With support from our incredible sponsors in 2022 and 2023 (see below), we are proud to have supported these POC Scholars Emeritus. We thank the members of the former POC Programming team for all of their amazing work, and have preserved their listings here as well.

The POC Programming track is now part of our Big Bad Con Scholarship program! Read all about it [here on our blog.](https://www.bigbadcon.com/blog/poc-programming-2024/)

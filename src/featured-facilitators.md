Go Play NW is committed to better supporting marginalized players and creators in TTRPG spaces. To further this goal, we’re inviting a few professional BIPOC GMs to share their games, work, and storytelling styles by hosting games for our attendees.

## Go Play Online Fall 2022
Keep an eye out for the Featured Facilitators for our upcoming online fall event! We'll be announcing them soon!

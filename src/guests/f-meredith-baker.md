Meri inherited the Baker family curse of game design, and has been playing and designing games since she was in middle school. As her siblings grew up, she became a regular GM in the Baker House Band, and is now working on several games, including Shell & Soul, a game of heroic bugs. She helps moderate several on-line spaces, and is partially nocturnal.

Meri will be running these games:

* [Strike Wing!](https://www.bigbadcon.com/events/strike-wing) (x2)
* [Breakfast and Game Design!](https://www.bigbadcon.com/events/breakfast-and-game-design-2/) (x2)

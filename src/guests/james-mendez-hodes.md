Mendez is a cultural consultant and game designer whom you might recognize from Avatar Legends, Dungeons & Dragons, the Jackbox Party Packs, or some articles complaining about orcs and racism. His interests include hip hop, comparative martial arts, and religious studies. He's excited to connect with other cultural consultants, both experienced and prospective, and to learn everyone's fighting style at the convention.

Mendez will be running these events:

* [Green Island Serenade](https://www.bigbadcon.com/events/green-island-serenade)
* [Killers in a Western Paradise](https://www.bigbadcon.com/events/killers-in-a-western-paradise) (Thousand Arrows)
* [Games on Demand](https://www.bigbadcon.com/events/games-on-demand-saturday-8pm-midnight-4)

Inside of games, Kathryn Hymes (she/her) and Hakan Seyalıoğlu (he/him) are the co-founders of Thorny Games, a game studio out of Washington D.C. Their work often deals with the intimate and epic stories behind the language we speak. They’ve won awards for their games like Dialect (Silver Ennie Game of the Year, Tabletop Game of the Year—Indiecade Europe) and Sign (Indiecade Finalist, Indie RPG award-winner). Newly released is Xenolanguage, a soulful sci-fi game about alien language, and upcoming this year is the Games to Bind Us Play Anthology. They regularly speak about games, language and technology at places like SXSW and GDC. They also partner with universities, museums and non-profits to make games as a form of research by design.

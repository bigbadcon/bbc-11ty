Lexi (@blackgirlmage) is a bombastic, high-energy, improv-driven storyteller, professional Game Master, game developer, composer, screenwriter, and plot-predicting extraordinaire. You may recognize her from the all-black, HBCU-inspired Strixhaven series "Strix U", where she explores inexplicable magic, captivating secrets, complex love, and blackness in parallel with black joy. Known for her "Famous Four-Shots", Lexi has a gift for delivering satisfying story beats, engaging with player agency, finding the fun alongside their players, and cutting directly to the hearts of their viewers. Lexi is also the creator of No Bump in the Night. In both the TTRPG and Magic: The Gathering they are always reaching for the stars and bringing joy to every table they land at!

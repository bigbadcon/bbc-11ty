LaTia Jacquise is one of the Community Managers for D\&D at Wizards of the Coast. Prior to that, she was the Community Relations Coordinator at Monte Cook Games and an admin for D\&D's Adventurers League, and has contributed to Wizards of the Coast, D\&D Beyond, and DMs Guild as a freelance writer. She is also a member of TakeThis.org's Community Review Board. As a streamer, she's appeared on many actual plays and one-shots, most notably as cast and several-time Dungeon Master for Rivals of Waterdeep. When not involved in TTRPG related activities, she enjoys growing her own food, cooking what she grows, amassing a hoard of stationery she'll never use, and acting as guardian to her feybeast of a dog.

LaTia will be running these games and panels:

* D\&D 5th Edition adventure of my design
* Blood on the Clocktower
* A panel on community management

Elliot joined the family business in 2018, and has published On the Old Dirt Road, Haunted, and an assortment of pieces on the Baker Patreon. With Tovey, Elliot has been developing Tales of Timberwind. When he's not writing or playing games, Elliot spends a lot of time thinking about three-dimensional design, in LEGO, stained glass, and jewelry.

Elliot will be running the games:

* [Haunted](https://www.bigbadcon.com/events/haunted-3)
* [Numbwater Salvage](https://www.bigbadcon.com/events/numbwater-salvage)

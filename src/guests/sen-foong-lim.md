Sen is constantly dreaming, even when he’s awake. He is passionate about helping people lose track of time in meaningful ways. Sen helped co-design board games like Belfort, Akrotiri, Junk Art, The Legend of Korra: Pro Bending Arena, Kingdom Rush: Rift in Time, Scooby-Doo: Escape from the Haunted Manor, MIND MGMT: The Psychic Espionage “Game”, and Rat Queens: To the Slaughter. He also co-authored the TTRPGs Jiangshi: Blood in the Banquet Hall, An Exquisite Crime, The Revenant Society, and Tiān Dēng (forthcoming from Evil Hat Productions). Sen has also contributed to The North Sea Epilogues, Gears of Defiance, Never Going Home, The Curse of the House of Rookwood, Tiny Supers, Mecha & Monsters: Evolved, Heckin’ Good Doggos, Queerz, Kids on Bikes, and Avatar: Legends. When he’s not making games, you can find him teaching psychology, practicing Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, writing stuff, and co-hosting the Ludology Podcast or the Meeple Syrup Show.

Sen will be running these events:

* Tiān Dēng
* Panels (TBD)

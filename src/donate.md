Big Bad Con, Inc.'s purpose is to provide and inclusive place to grow the gaming community and provide industry opportunities both at our yearly convention and online. Big Bad Con hosts a gaming convention full of high quality role playing games every October in the Bay Area. We offer educational improvisation classes, game design workshops, opportunities to meet and play with game designers, and a platform for experimentation and play-testing with role playing, freeform, board, card, and live action games.

Weâ€™re a volunteer run [501c3 non-profit organization](https://www.bigbadcon.com/non-profit) comprised of wonderful volunteers, staff, GMs, and players.

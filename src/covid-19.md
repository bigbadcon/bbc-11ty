While many organizations and agencies have relaxed their COVID-19 policies and the CDC has seen a significant reduction in severe cases and hospitalizations, COVID-19 is still a serious threat for members of our community who are at higher risk due to a weakened immune system or underlying conditions.

While we recognize that even with the best precautions and measures we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contracting COVID-19, we hope that our community will support and comply with our policies in order to protect the most vulnerable of our community members.

Please review the following requirements, protective measures, and recommendations we have put in place for Go Play NW 2023. If you have any questions about these policies, please [contact us](/contact-us).

* [Vaccines and masks are required](#vaccines-and-masks-are-required)
* [Protective measures](#protective-measures)

1. **Masking:** You must wear a KN95-level or higher mask that covers your nose and mouth while indoors at all times. Masks may be removed outdoors and while eating and drinking, but we ask that you put your mask on between bites or sips.

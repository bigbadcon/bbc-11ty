Big Bad Con has a long history, starting all the way back in 2010! Our blog goes all the way back to that [very first two sentence post about the con](/blog/announcing-big-bad-con/). We are working on adding an archive here of all the amazing games and events over the years. We're a small team and the focus right now is on all the amazing things we have in store for 2022. For now you can check out the events from last year's first Big Bad Online 2021!

the Small Press Showcase is a space for self publishers, small press, crafters, and artists to vend their games, art, and creative works. Open the same hours as the [**Dealer’s Room**](/dealers), the Small Press Showcase is free to any vendor already attending the con.

## How it works:

Once you have a badge, fill out the form below to become one of our Small Press Showcase vendors, then head over [**here**](https://www.bigbadcon.com/events/categories/vending/) to book your times (**maximum 3 shifts**) in the showcase.

During that time you can sell your wares, make art, run demos, or otherwise share your creative work with our wonderful attendees. You’ll process all sales yourself and the con charges no fees (except getting a badge to attend) to be in the Small Press Showcase.

We have room for up to four vendors at a time, and each of you will have half of a 8′ long table to display your wares. At the end of your shift, we ask that you clean up for the next vendor coming after you.

We’ make a schedule for the attendees so they know when to find you as well! More questions? Email [**info@bigbadcon.com**](mailto:info@bigbadcon.com) and we’ll get back to you asap.

You must already have a badge to sign up as a small press vendor. You can get a badge through the Kickstarer campaign (until June 6), Buying one here (after June 6), or singing up as volunteer or GM.

Go Play NW would like to acknowledge that the land on which we host our in person events is unceded ancestral land belonging to the Duwamish people. The Duwamish are a people that still live and work in Seattle today.  We recognize, also, that a simple land acknowledgment cannot be enough. Find out more about how you can lend your support to the [Dwuamish Tribe through their website (click here)](www.duwamishtribe.org/stand-with-the-duwamish).  

If you are curious about why Go Play NW is making a land acknowledgment or wish to find out more about land acknowledgments as a practice, see A Guide to Indigenous Land Acknowledgement at the [Native Governance Center](http://nativegov.org).

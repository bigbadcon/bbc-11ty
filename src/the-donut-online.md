## What is the Donut?{#what-is-the-donut}
The Donut is Go Play NW‚Äôs pitch circle/muster-style pick-up-and-play event. It gets people together to play games without needing to schedule them in advance.

At Go Play NW we make it our mission to ensure that everyone gets to play a game‚Äîwe want all of our attendees to have the opportunity to game every session. Since we don't always have enough [scheduled games](/events) planned in advance, the Donut provides those opportunities.

When you join the Donut, you‚Äôre taking a chance. You might not get into exactly the game you want, but there will be a spot for everyone! Many folks have found great games they would never have discovered by joining games that weren‚Äôt their first choice! However, by joining the Donut, you‚Äôve made no promise to play. If you don‚Äôt like the available options, you can always bow out. 

Simply put: it‚Äôs a great way to meet new friends and games!

Once you're checked in, keep an eye out at the all you need to do is keep an eye out at the [üç©-donut-official channel](https://discord.com/channels/432927690543202313/1014257716925038633) for an announcement that the Donut is about to begin!

## Here‚Äôs how the Donut goes down
1. Just before the Donut starts we'll post an announcement to the [üç©-donut-official channel](https://discord.com/channels/432927690543202313/1014257716925038633). 
2. Everyone who wants to participate gathers at the [Donut Stage](https://discord.com/channels/432927690543202313/1014258413674434630). 
2. The Donut Assistant posts a poll to the [üç©-donut-official channel](https://discord.com/channels/432927690543202313/1014257716925038633) to take a headcount of how many folks are participating while the Donut MC calls the Donut to order. 
3. The Donut MC will ask a for volunteer game facilitators to then asks for a number of volunteer facilitators to fit the available number of players and guide these volunteers in pitching games they‚Äôre excited to run to the rest of the Donut.
4. Each of the game facilitators takes a turn pitching games they're excited to run to the rest of the Donut and posts a summary of their pitch to the [üç©-donut-official channel](https://discord.com/channels/432927690543202313/1014257716925038633).
5. Once everyone who wants to has given their pitch, our Tech Support volunteers will post a sign-up list to [üç©-donut-official channel](https://discord.com/channels/432927690543202313/1014257716925038633)
6. Sometimes certain games are more or less popular. In the instance that a game is overfull or doesn‚Äôt fill, the Donut MC will try to help players and facilitators find a solution that works best for them.
7. Game facilitators each create their own private game room by clicking on ‚ûï Create Game Room.
8. Players and facilitators find a table (sometimes with a Volunteer‚Äôs help) and play their games! 

## Tips For a Good Donut{#tips-for-a-good-donut}
* If you‚Äôre new to pitch circles/musters, we recommend you don‚Äôt pitch a game your first time. Games need players and facilitators to run, and it can help to watch before doing.
* If there‚Äôs a game you really want to see played in the Donut, the best way to make that happen is to pitch it!
* Don‚Äôt worry if you forget some information in your pitch. The Donut MC will help by providing prompts when you need them. 
* Don‚Äôt feel up to pitching but still have a burning need to play? If the Donut is low on facilitators, sometimes requesting a game can be all the inspiration someone needs.
* Don‚Äôt like public speaking? We‚Äôd love to put your game on our events schedule. [Submit a game here!](/run-an-event/) 
* You are never obligated to play in any games at Go Play NW. Joining the Donut does not require you to join a game. It‚Äôs always ok to bounce!

## How can I help with the Donut?{#want-to-help}
Although games in the Donut are spontaneous, you can help things run smoothly by preparing a bit ahead of time.

Here are a few ways you can support the Donut:

1. **Volunteer with us!**  
_Go play NW is always looking for helpers! Find out more about how to volunteer for the Donut [here](/volunteer)._
2. **Think about games you want to pitch!**  
_Facilitators are an essential part of the Donut! Without them, there would be no games._
3. **Play a game!**  
_Games don‚Äôt work without players. You don‚Äôt have to facilitate a game to help out; just show up with enthusiasm and openness to meet new people and try new games!_
4. **Join us for Lobby Con!**  
_The Friday evening social (aka LobbyCon) happens from 6:00 PM to 8:30 PM PDT and is open to everyone. In addition to letting you meet up with old friends and make new ones, it helps our event volunteers by getting everyone checked in early. Then, on Saturday and Sunday we can jump quickly into the Donuts and get games going!_
